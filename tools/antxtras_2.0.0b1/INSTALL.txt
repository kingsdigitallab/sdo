INSTALLATION

1. Download and install all required third-party Java packages. Verify
   that each package is properly installed. Currently Ant version 1.7.x
   is required for AntXtras 2.x distributions.

2. Download, verify, and extract a JWare/AntXtras distribution. The new
   user should download the binary distribution that includes a sample
   build script that can be used to verify your installation.

   * To verify the PGP signature of the downloaded archive, get the
     JWare distribution KEYS from http://purl.net/jware/KEYS

   * If you must manually generate all binaries for your environment,
     download the source-only distribution. The included "ez-build.xml"
     Ant build file can generate a default distribution from the source.
     Be sure you configure the "ez-build.properties" file for your
     environment. Read the AntXtras download web page for a list of 
     required third-party packages.

3. Update your development and Ant run environment to include the main 
   AntXtras jar file in your ANT classpath. The required jar is found
   at <ANTXTRAS_HOME>/lib/jw-antxtras.jar.

4. Verify AntXtras classes are accessible in your ANT runtime environment.
   The easiest way to do this is to try loading the AntXtras antlib using
   a simple <taskdef> declaration; for example:
   <taskdef resource="org/jwaresoftware/antxtras/install/antlib.xml"/>

5. Read the AntXtras Overview on the website for a list of the most used
   antlib components and a set of quick-start examples.
