Entity Management in SDO

All of the entities stored in EATS, with only sufficient information
to disambiguate. Additional profile information is kept in XML files,
named according to their EATS authority record ID. Information about
the references to this entity in the collection is stored in a Solr
index.

When a request is made for an entity page, the information from these
three sources is merged. The EATS information is not retrieved from
EATS on each request, however. Instead it is taken from an index file
(necessary for the profile indices) that is cached for a goodly
time. This index is a transformed EATSML dump.
