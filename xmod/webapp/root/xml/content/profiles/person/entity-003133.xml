        <p>American musicologist, librarian, first editor of <title level="m">The Musical
            Quarterly</title>. </p>

        <p>Born in the USA, Oscar Sonneck studied philosophy and musicology at the universities of
          Heidelberg and Munich, as well as piano, conducting, and composition. He was appointed
          head of the Music Division of the Library of Congress in 1902, where he built up its
          comprehensive collection of printed books and music, and manuscripts. </p>

        <p>In 1915, he became the founding editor of <title level="m">The Musical Quarterly</title>,
          and in 1917, having resigned from the Library of Congress, he joined the publication
          department of the periodical's publisher, G. Schirmer. </p>

        <p>His many publications include <title level="m">Bibliography of Early Secular American
            Music</title> (1905) and <title level="m">Early Concert Life in America
            (1731â€’1800)</title> (1907). His classification system, published in 1904, became the
          basis for the Library of Congress Music Collection's classification. Late in life, he
          edited <title level="m">Beethoven Letters in America</title> (1927). His works form part
          of the founding layer of American musical scholarship.</p>
