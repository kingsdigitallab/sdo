      <head>Josef Reitler</head>
      <div>

        <p>Viennese Jewish music critic, teacher, and administrator; regular contributor to the <ref
            cRef="entity-002559"><title level="j">Neue freie Presse</title></ref> over several
          decades.</p>

        <div>
          <p>Josef Reitler was the son of banker Robert Reitler and his wife Eugenie. He took
            private lessons in violin and piano in Vienna, and studied music theory with <ref
              cRef="entity-000798">Arnold Schoenberg</ref> 1902‒05. Reitler worked as the music and
            theater correspondent for the Berlin <ref cRef="entity-002565"><title level="j"
                >Vossische Zeitung</title></ref> in Paris 1905‒07, then became editor for and music
            critic of the <ref cRef="entity-002559"><title level="j">Neue freie
            Presse</title></ref>, eventually succeeding <ref cRef="entity-000471">Julius
              Korngold</ref>. He also wrote several opera libretti.</p>

          <p>He was appointed director of the <ref cRef="entity-002451"><title level="j">Neues
                Wiener Konservatorium</title></ref> in 1915, remaining in that post until the
            conservatory's closure by the Nazis in 1938 after the Anschluss. It was during his
            directorship that the Vienna Schenker Institute was founded within the conservatory in
            1935.</p>

          <p>In 1938 he emigrated to the United States, working in the opera department of the New
            York College of Music 1940‒45, and teaching also at Hunter College, dying in New York in
            1948.</p>

          <head>Reitler and the Schenker circle</head>
          <p>As a reader of the <ref cRef="entity-002559"><title level="j">Neue freie
              Presse</title></ref>, Schenker saw Reitler's articles and reviews, and commented
            sardonically on many of them in his diaries between 1912 and 1932, e.g. on an article of
            May 22, 1924 referring to the centenary re-enactment of the original performance of
            Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on May 7 of that year: "In the evening edition [...] Reitler,
            on the occasion of the Ninth Symphony, rides out against all the world's theorists and
            extols the intuitive genius of the man who ‒ touches up the original score! As if
            Beethoven were lacking intuitive genius!" Schenker commented, also, in letters to close
            colleagues, and shared jokes about Reitler. — Clippings of two articles by Reitler are
            preserved among Schenker's papers in the Oster Collection (2/pp.85/86, B/449). </p>
