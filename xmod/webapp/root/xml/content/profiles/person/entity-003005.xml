        <p>Austrian composer and conductor. </p>

        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Zemlinsky achieved early success as a composer with chamber works that won the approval
          of Brahms when performed by the Tonkünstlerverein in Vienna. He met the 18-year old <ref
            cRef="entity-000798">Arnold Schoenberg</ref> in 1893, conducting an amateur orchestra in
          which Schoenberg played cello and providing him with some basic technical instruction in
          composition. Schoenberg would marry Zemlinsky's sister Mathilde in 1901, and the two were
          close colleagues in the struggle to promote progressive new music in Vienna between 1903
          and 1911.</p>

        <p>Zemlinsky's career as a conductor began in Vienna in 1900 and with Mahler's support he
          was appointed to posts at the Theater an der Wien (1903‒04) and the Volksoper (1904‒11).
          As a composer he achieved notable success in opera and chamber music, as well as with his
          rather Mahlerian <title level="m">Lyric Symphony</title> (1922‒23). After prestigious
          conducting posts in Leipzig and Berlin (1911‒31) he returned to Vienna before leaving for
          America in 1938. He died there in 1942. </p>

        <head>Zemlinsky and Schenker</head>

        <p>Zemlinsky was co-signatory with Schoenberg and Gutheil to one letter to Schenker of
          January 1904 (OJ 14/15, [8]). He is mentioned once, in a letter to Julius Röntgen of April
          13, 1901 in which Schenker reports that the bass soloist <ref cRef="entity-000274">Eduard
            Gärtner</ref> sang Schenker's <title level="m">Wiegenliedchen</title>, together with
          songs by Zemlinsky and others, with Zemlinsky as his accompanist (NMI C 176-01). </p>
