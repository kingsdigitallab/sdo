      <head>Klara [Clara] Schiff [Hatschek]</head>
      <div>

        <p>Sister-in-law to <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jeannette Schenker</ref> [<hi rend="italic"
            >née</hi> Schiff; Kornfeld], thus also to Heinrich Schenker from 1919. Wife of Oskar
          Hatschek.</p>

        <p>All five of Jeanette Schenker's sisters were younger than she, and Klara appears to have
          been the third daughter of Wilhelm and Emilie Schiff. She was married to Oskar
          Hatschek.</p>

        <p>After Jeanette left her first husband, <ref cRef="entity-000466">Emil Kornfeld</ref>, and
          the family home town of <ref cRef="entity-002248">Aussig an der Elbe</ref>, she apparently
          did not see Klara ‒ or any of her other sisters or her three brothers ‒ until eighteen
          years later, in the summer of 1928, when Klara, her husband Oskar, and son Helmut, visited
          Heinrich and her at their summer refuge of <ref cRef="entity-002292">Galtür</ref> in the
          Tyrol, arriving on July 30 and staying for most of August. Heinrich gives his impressions
          of her in his diary for August 3 (OJ 4/1, pp. 3238‒3239): <cit>
            <q>My sister-in-law Clara is a splendid woman; she refuses here – sensibly – to preach
              in her innate way, and also takes care not to express her pacifist and world-blessing
              ideas (<hi rend="italic">pazifistischen u. weltbeglückenden Ideen</hi>), since she
              knows that I am not comfortable with such things. I get the distinct feeling that the
              two of them are respecting my intellectual world, on account of which I willingly
              express my agreement to respect theirs.</q>
          </cit></p>

        <p>On August 24 Heinrich and Klara went hiking in the Jam Valley, and Schenker reports their
          conversation: "We intentionally said farewell to all megalomania and communism in
          intellectual matters!" (OJ 4/1, p. 3245). In bidding farewell to the visitors on the 26th,
          Schenker records in his diary that in spite of their intelligence he could not live "in
          the pretentious world of my Lie-Liechen's siblings," with its provincialism. Klara and
          Helmuth took many photographs of Galtür and surroundings that they sent to the Schenkers
          in the October (OJ 4/2, p. 3270).</p>

        <head>Correspondence</head>
        <p>The diary gives evidence that Jeanette maintained correspondence with Klara, but no items
          are known to survive. One letter from Victor Schiff to Klara from 1925 survives in a
          transcript by Anna Schiff (OJ 14/8). </p>
