          the Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia (1924-26), then returned to the Institute of

        <head>Wedge and Schenker</head>
        <p>As early as 1925, <ref cRef="entity-000934">Gerald F. Warburg</ref> reported that Wedge
          was "lecturing on the Urline" at the Institute of Musical Art (OJ 3/8, p. 2876). In a 1932
          interview, Irvin Kolodin, who studied at the Institute while Wedge was teaching there,
          described him as "a pioneer in [Schenker's] work in America." <ref cRef="entity-000951"
            >Hans Weisse</ref> speaks of Wedge as: "the chief director of the Institute of Musical
          Art, who has been teaching according to your books for a long, long time, and is dying to
          meet me and learn more from me." (<ref type="person" cRef="OJ-15-16_82">OJ 15/16,
            [82]</ref>, October 15, 1931). Wedge is said to have produced a graph of the "Liebestod"
          from Wagner's <title level="m">Tristan und Isolde</title> (Berry).</p>
        <p>There is no known correspondence between Wedge and Schenker.</p>
