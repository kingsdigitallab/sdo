      <head>Willi Reich</head>
      <div>

        <p>Austrian writer on music and biographer of Alban Berg, writer of monographs on Bartók,
          Berg, Schoenberg, and other topics.</p>

        <p>Reich completed a dissertation on Martini at the University of Vienna in 1934, was a
          pupil of Berg 1927–35 and Webern 1936‒38, and served as music critic for several newpapers
          in Vienna and abroad. From 1932 to 1937 he edited the journal <title level="j">23—eine
            Wiener Musikzeitschrift</title>, in which the current Viennese musical world was
          criticized, and which vigorously championed the Second Viennese School; in the June 1933
          issue, he criticized National Socialism. The journal was banned after the Anschluss.</p>

        <p>Reich moved to Switzerland in 1938, where he worked as a freelance writer and music
          critic and lectured at the Technische Hochschule in Zurich (1959‒70).</p>

        <head>Reich and the Schenker circle</head>
        <p>Reich was well aware of Schenker's work, for he wrote an article <title level="a">Kant,
            Schenker, und der Nachläufer</title> in <title level="j">23—eine Wiener
            Musikzeitschrift</title> 15‒16 (1934), in which he accused Oswald Jonas of lying in his
              <bibl><title level="m">Das Wesen des musikalischen Kunstwerks</title> (Vienna: Saturn
            Verlag, 1934), p. 54</bibl>. Jonas produced a response, "<title level="u">Vorläufer und
            Nachläufer. (Ein Dokumentarischer Nachweis)</title>," prepared for a lawsuit against
          Reich and not published. (A copy of the issue containing Reich's article is preserved
          among Schenker's papers as OC 30/89, together with a typescript of Jonas's response as OC
          30/91‒98; another copy of both articles is preserved as OJ 38/52.)</p>

        <p>This matter is raised in a letter from Jonas to Schenker (OC 44/9, Oct 27, 1934), which
          includes the remark "Mr. Reich even partly opened his heart for Schenker, at least for the
          valuable original editions," suggesting that at some point Reich had contacted Schenker in
          relation either to the latter's Beethoven piano sonata edition (1921‒24) or to the
          Photogram Archive. However, on May 31, 1933 (diary), Schenker had written to Herman Roth
          that he "knew nothing about Reich."</p>
