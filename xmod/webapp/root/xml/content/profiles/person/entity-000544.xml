      <head>Erich Ludendorff</head>

      <div>
        <p>Alongside Paul von Hindenburg, the leading general of World War I. He was joint commander

        <head>Correspondence with Schenker</head>

        <p>Schenker wrote to Ludendorff on November 12, 1919 (diary OJ 3/3, p. 2400--the letter does
          not survive) enclosing a copy of his <title level="j">Der Tonwille</title>, Heft 1 (1921),
          and received a brief but sympathetic handwritten reply (OC 24/11: November 19, 1921,
          received November 21, and forwarded to Hertzka on 23rd). He had made an allusion to "the
          genius of those two time-honored generals, Hindenburg and Ludendorff" in his lead article
          to the journal, <title level="a">The Mission of German Genius.</title> Schenker received a
          second, shorter reply (OC 24/11: January 21, 1922[?]), perhaps in response to his first
          letter, or perhaps to a second, saying that Ludendorff had read the pages indicated by
          Schenker and had been "spiritually uplifted" by them.</p>

        <p>(He also received a letter from <ref cRef="entity-000374">Paul Hindenburg</ref> (OC
          24/18: November 19, 1921), and the draft of Schenker's initial letter survives (OC
          24/14-15, undated).)</p>
