      <head>Karl [Karol; Carl] (von) Klobassa(-Zrencki) (Dr.)</head>
      <div>

        <p>Pupil of Heinrich Schenker's in the 1890s and 1900s.</p>

        <head>Career</head>
        <p>Son of Wiktor Klobassa (1849–96), grandson of Karol Klobassa senior (1823–86), pioneer of
          crude oil mining in Galicia, who was admitted to the Polish aristocracy with the suffix
          “-Zrencki,” and the title “hrabia” (equivalent to “Earl” in English society). Karol (Karl)
          junior inherited this rank at his father’s death. He, too, became an important figure in
          the petroleum-naphtha industy in Poland, and a board member of the East European Crude Oil
          Association (Iriag) in the 1920s. On May 22, 1930 he is recorded as a patient at the Oskar
          Mautner Waldsanatorium in <ref cRef="entity-006737">Perchtoldsdorf</ref>, southwest of
          Vienna, where he is described as “Vice-Minister, Honorary Attaché of the Polish legation.”
          Where he died four years later is unknown.</p>

        <head>Klobassa and Schenker</head>
        <p>Klobassa is first referred to in Schenker's diary on September 12, 1897 as "my pupil,"
          where he is mysteriously likened to Hamlet. Whether or not he continued taking lessons in
          the intervening period is unknown, but he certainly did so in 1906/07. In December 1906 he
          was late paying his fees, and again in June 1907 his end-of-year fees, such that Schenker
          had to threaten legal action (diary, May 1907) in order to force him to pay up. Klobassa
          failed to attend at the beginning of the teaching year 1907/08 (diary, October 1,
          1907).</p>

        <p>On April 14, 1914, Schenker’s diary records: “visiting card [without address] of a former
          pupil, Carl von Klobassa, who paid me a visit on Easter Monday.” He told the building
          caretaker that he had “not seen [Schenker] for six years”, which if taken strictly would
          mean he last saw him in 1908.</p>
