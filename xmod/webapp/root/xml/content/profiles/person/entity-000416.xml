      <head>Marianne Kahn</head>
      <div>
        <p>Long-time pupil of Schenker's.</p>
        <p>Kahn first introduced herself to Schenker on January 17, 1907 (diary OJ 1/6, p. 32),
          became a pupil of his from September 23, 1907 (diary OJ 1/6, p. 48) until at least 1932.
          She appears in the Lesson Books 1913-31 (OC 3/1-4) there are lesson notes for her from
          1931-32 (OC 16/35-37); and there is a letter from Schenker to her of 1934 (OC 44/23). She
          is recorded as having left Vienna for Sanremo in Italy on July 21, 1939, and nothing is
          known of her thereafter.</p>

        <head>Kahn and Schenker</head>

        <p>Schenker's diaries show signs of irritation with Marianne Kahn from 1927 onward,
          including this depth analysis of her (Nov 17, 1928): <cit>
            <q>Miss Kahn unexpectly gives me cause for resistance, expecially in the repeat of
              Träumerei, which she requested for a pupil of hers. I lost my patience; I saw myself
              confronted by the failure of my personal kindness, my pedagogical effort, to produce
              any results after more than twenty years. I was disgusted by a truly dissolute vanity,
              which treats the greatest masters of the world and their most faithful servant – who
              is in his own way also a master – as a support-beam, pushing itself to the forefront
              over and over again. Ultimately, an erotic cause would have made the will to power of
              such a vanity understandable; but a vanity that has no purpose whatever and yet
              demands such holy sacrifices allows me to keep my patience no longer. I rebuked her
              severely and reminded her that she is coming to a musician whose job consists
              precisely in determining the unconditional in performance, so that there is no more
              room for the pupil. Whereupon I put her under duress; and she cooperated – not
              willingly, but nonetheless. She even remarked: "I cannot force myself" – whereupon I
              replied curtly: "You must." The depravity of this narcissism, which is all the more
              objectionable the more it is the natural state of affairs – thus in a certain sense
              belongs to the innocence of her sex life, i.e. there is something bestial about it –
              consists specifically of her being unwilling to be compelled even by the greatest
              master, but on the other hand wishes to force the masters and their servants down to
              her low level. I hope that this harsh rebuke will have good consequences, at least for
              myself. It is sad enough that the young lady, on account of her opposition, has lost
              so many years of the best opportunity to learn free of charge and finally, in spite of
              all help, may herself be satisfied with what she cannot do at all. Yet it is time to
              look away from this picture; the young lady deserves nothing better. Whether or not
              this is animalistic innocence, as soon as she causes such harm it must, according to
              general custom, be utterly destroyed.</q>

        <head>Correspondence</head>
        <p>Correspondence between Angi Elias and the Schenkers suggests that Kahn and Elias were
          close friends. Kahn was a piano teacher in her own right, and Schenker occasionally passed
          students on to her.</p>
