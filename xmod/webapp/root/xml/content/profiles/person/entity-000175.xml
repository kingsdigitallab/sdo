      <head>Sandra Droucker [Drouker; Droucher] </head>
      <div>

        <p>Russian Jewish pianist and teacher, who in late career studied and was an advocate for
          Schenkerian theory.</p>

          <head>Career Summary</head>

          <p>Daughter of a German father and Russian mother, Sandra Droucker studied at the St.
            Petersburg Conservatory with Anton Rubinstein. She made her debut in 1894. In the 1880s
            she was living in Berlin. She taught at the Stern Conservatory, Berlin 1904‒06, married
            Austrian pianist <ref cRef="entity-000271">Gottfried Galston</ref> in 1910, changed her
            name to Droucker-Galston, and moved to Munich; the marriage lasted only to 1918. At the
            beginning of World War II she settled in Oslo, becoming a Norwegian citizen in 1938.</p>

          <p>She wrote a book of memories of Anton Rubinstein's teaching at the St Petersburg
            Conservatory (Leipzig: Bartholf Senff, 1904), and also <title level="m">Et blad av Oslos
              musikkhistorie</title> (1945).</p>

          <p>In the mid-1920s Droucker was a pupil of <ref cRef="entity-000922">Otto
              Vrieslander</ref>. In his diary Schenker records hearing her play two etudes by
            Scriabin on the radio (March 17, 1925), visiting her (April 6, 1926), and receiving from
            Vrieslander a program of a private concert in which she played "Ländler and
            Vrieslander's arrangement of Bach's Toccata in D minor" (June 13, 1927).</p>

          <p><ref cRef="entity-000412">Oswald Jonas</ref> also records that she was a pupil of his:
            he wrote to Schenker reporting a lecture on Schenker that she had given in Oslo (<ref
              type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-12-6_38">OJ 12/6, [38]</ref>, September 25, 1932; and a
            private concert by her in which she included the Paganini Variations "with really
            astonishing beauty" (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-12-6_19">OJ 12/6, [19]</ref>,
            January 28, 1933).</p>
