        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Ernst Roth studied law, music, and philosophy at Prague University, serving on the
          Eastern Front in World War I. After receiving his doctorate of law in 1921, he worked with
          the Wiener Philharmonsicher Verlag in Vienna from 1923â€“28. When that publishing house was
          acquired by <ref cRef="universal_edition">Universal Edition</ref> in 1925, he worked in a
          senior capacity in the UE office from then until 1938. </p>
        <p>He left UE at the aryanization of the firm on September 20, 1938, and emigrated to
          England, where he worked at Boosey &amp; Hawkes until his death in 1971, becoming the
          company's chairman in 1963. He was on friendly terms with Schoenberg, Richard Strauss (who
          dedicated the last of his <title level="m">Four Last Songs</title> to him), Stravinsky,
          and Webern. As Vice-President of the Music Section of the International Publisher's
          Association from 1959, his expertise in law and music enabled him to draft complex
          legislation on international music rights. Commanding a wide range of European languages,
          he was active as a translator of operatic and vocal music. </p>
        <p>His books, in German and English, include a study of Richard Strauss's stage works
          (1954), a short history of European music (1961), a co-edited catalog of Strauss's works
          (1964), and three volumes of autobiographical reflections (1969, 1971, 1974). Besides
          music, he wrote articles on literature, history, art, and philosophy. </p>

          the signatory of one letter to Jeanette: UEA [1], item [6] (1938). His reference on UE
