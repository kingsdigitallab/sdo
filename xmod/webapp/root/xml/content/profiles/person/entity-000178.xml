      <div>
        <p>Scottish pianist, theorist, and writer on music.</p>

        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Dunn studied at Edinburgh University with Friedrich Niecks and later at the Stuttgart
          Conservatory with Samuel de Lange (theory) and Max von Pauer (piano), and in 1902 joined
          the teaching faculty there. In 1909 he was appointed to the Kiel Conservatory, first as
          professor of piano, later as deputy director, but returned to Britain in 1914, serving and
          being wounded in World War I. After the war, he settled in Edinburgh (Scotland), where he
          worked as piano teacher and concert artist, later teaching music theory at Edinburgh
          University 1920-31.</p>
        <p>His books include <title level="m">Das Geheimnis der Handführung beim
          Klavierspiel</title> (1914), <title level="m">Ornamentation in the Works of Chopin</title>
          (London: Novello, 1921), <title level="m">A Student's Guide to Orchestration</title>
          (London: Novello, 1928), based on his Edinburgh DMus thesis, and <title level="m">The
            Basis of Pianoforte Playing</title> (London: OUP, 1933), completed posthumously by his
          wife, Aline Dunn (a native German-speaker). He was killed in a street accident in
        1931.</p>

        <head>Dunn and Schenker</head>
        <p>Though never a pupil of Schenker's, Dunn became a disciple of his on the basis of the
          study of Schenker's writings, and Schenker took pride in the fact that his theory was
          being taught in Edinburgh. Dunn prepared an abbreviated English translation of Schenker's
            <ref cRef="entity-001725">
            <title>Kontrapunkt</title>
          </ref> that remained unpublished.</p>
        <p>A verbal portrait of Dunn is presented by Anthony van Hoboken when he visited him in
          September 1927: OJ 11/54, [18], September 18, 1927. [insert link]</p>

      <div>
        <head>Correspondence and Portraits</head>
        <p>There survive a copy of one (draft?) letter from Schenker to Dunn dated July 8, 1928 (OC
          30/122-124), five others from Schenker to Dunn that are not known to have survived, and
          are here designated Dunn [1]-[5], eight letters from Dunn to Schenker, 1926-30, and two
          from Dunn's widow dated 1931 together with a clipping and typed German translation of D.
          F. Tovey's obituary for Dunn in <title level="j">The Scotsman</title>, February 6, 1931
          (OJ 10/12 and 10/13).</p>
        <p>Schenker owned two inscribed photographic portraits, one of John, one of John and Aline
          (OJ 72/4), and a copy of <title level="m">A Student's Guide to Orchestration</title> (OC
          2/p. 80); this work contains what is probably the first published translation of an
          extract from Schenker's writings (taken from the monograph on Beethoven's Ninth
        Symphony).</p>
