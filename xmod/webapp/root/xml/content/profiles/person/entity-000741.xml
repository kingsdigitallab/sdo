      <div>
        <p>Member of office staff at <ref cRef="entity-002408">Universal Edition</ref>, Vienna for
          more than 40 years. </p>

        <p> Barbara Rothe joined <ref cRef="entity-002408">Universal Edition</ref> on October 1,
          1906, five years after the company had been formed and while <ref cRef="entity-000946"
            >Josef Weinberger</ref>, <ref cRef="entity-000359">Bernhard Herzmansky</ref> and <ref
            cRef="entity-000720">Adolf Robitschek</ref> were still joint chairmen, before the
          arrival of <ref cRef="entity-000356">Emil Hertzka</ref> as Director in 1907. She was at
          various times secretary to <ref cRef="entity-000356s">Emil Hertzka</ref>, administrator,
          and office manageress. She was still listed with the company in 1947; she thus continued
          in employment after <ref cRef="entity-002408">Universal Edition</ref> (a primarily Jewish
          firm) was aryanized in 1938, and into the post-war period.</p>

        <p>Barbara Rothe is the signatory to four letters to Heinrich Schenker, two in 1908 and 1910
          (OC 52/32 and 53) and two in 1912 (OC 52/85 and 86); and <ref cRef="entity-000771"
            >Jeanette Schenker</ref> wrote two postcards to her, in 1939 and 1940 (UEA [12], [13]),
          in which she addressed her as "Prokuristin" (signatory, proxy). In addition, there are
          numerous typewritten letters from <ref cRef="entity-000356">Emil Hertzka</ref> to Schenker
          with the typist identification “R” beneath the printed letterhead, which may well indicate
          that it was Rothe who took dictation and typed the letter.</p>
