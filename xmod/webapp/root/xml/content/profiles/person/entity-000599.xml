        <head>Mittelmann and Schenker</head>
        <p>Mittelmann is first mentioned in Schenker's diary on November 3, 1902 (OJ 1/4, p. 9: "By
          faithful translation Mittelmann puts me on so many other scents"); again on September 3,
          1906 (p. 19), October 22, 1906 (p. 22), and February 4, 1907 (p. 33). By 1912, he had
          apparently fallen on hard times, and Schenker tried to help him by employing him in
          proof-correcting and similar work for, e.g., <ref cRef="entity-001733"><title level="m"
              >Die letzten funf Sonaten von Beethoven</title></ref>, and by seeking support for him
          from his own wealthy contacts. He was evidently an educated man, for Schenker's diary for
          July 24, 1921 notes: "Mrs. Pairamall is learning Greek with him." (OJ 3/2, p. 2368), and
          that for June 22, 1926 (OJ 3/8, p. 2832) remarks " Mittelmann in the evening: as fresh as
          ever, shows strong continuous memory, recites Greek and Polish verses! stays until
          9:45."</p>

        <p>Around the end of World War I he was allegedly involved in the black market (OJ 2/10, p.
          837: "Mittelmann turns out to be a black marketeer: we order twine from him."),
          consequently he supplied Heinrich and Jeanette with unobtainable commodities. Schenker
          continued to use him as an amanuensis at least late into the 1920s.</p>

        <p>His birth date is deduced from the statement in Schenker's diary on December 10, 1927
          that Mittelmann had "celebrated on this day: his 71st birthday!" (OJ 4/1, p. 3148). That
          is corroborated by the statement on March 23, 1925 (OJ 3/7, pp. 2800-2801): <cit>
            <q>Mittelmann in the evening; according to his birth certificate, he is 69 years old! He
              is healthy and alert, was talkative the entire evening, apparently because we gave him
              the opportunity to show us his exercises in construction.</q>
          </cit></p>

        <p>In 1916, Mittelmann is recorded in Lehmann's Vienna Addressbook as living at Vienna XVII,
          Wurlitzergasse 89 ‒ which is still nowadays (2013) a shelter for the homeless. His last
          address in 1942 was Vienna X, Alxingergasse 97.</p>

        <p>As a Jew, Mittelmann was deported by the Nazis to the concentration camp Theresienstadt
          (Terezín) in German-occupied Bohemia on August 27‒28, 1942 (two months after Jeanette
          Schenker), on transport IV/9, no. 60 (1,008 people being taken, of which 970 were murdered
          and 38 survived), and was murdered there on November 16 of the same year.</p>

        <head>Correspondence between Mittelmann and Schenker</head>
        <p>A great deal passed between the two men, but only one postcard, from Mittelmann to
          Schenker, survives in OJ 8/1 (1913: misfiled among postcards from Schenker to Moriz
          Violin), and also two postcards from him to Violin as OJ 70/28 (1912).</p>
