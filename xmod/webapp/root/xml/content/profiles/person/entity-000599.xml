        <head>Mittelmann and Schenker</head>
        <p>Mittelmann is first mentioned in Schenker's diary on November 3, 1902 (OJ 1/4, p. 9: "By
          faithful translation Mittelmann puts me on so many other scents"); again on September 3,
          1906 (p. 19), October 22, 1906 (p. 22), and February 4, 1907 (p. 33). By 1912, he had
          apparently fallen on hard times, and Schenker tried to help him by employing him in
          proof-correcting and similar work for, e.g., <title level="m">Die letzten funf Sonaten von
            Beethoven</title>, and by seeking support for him from his own wealthy contacts. He was
          evidently an educated man, for Schenker's diary for July 24, 1921 notes: "Mrs. Pairamall
          is learning Greek with him." (OJ 3/2, p. 2368).</p>

        <p>Around the end of World War I he was allegedly involved in the black market (OJ 2/10, p.
          837: "Mittelmann turns out to be a black marketeer: we order twine from him."),
          consequently he supplied Heinrich and Jeanette with unobtainable commodities. Schenker
          continued to use him as an amanuensis at least late into the 1920s.</p>

        <head>Correspondence with Schenker</head>
        <p>One postcard from Mittelmann to Schenker survives in OJ 8/1 (1913: misfiled among
          postcards from Schenker to Moriz Violin), and also two postcards from him to Violin as OJ
          70/28 (1912).</p>
