      <head>Israel Citkowitz</head>
      <div>
        <p>Polish-born American pianist, composer, teacher and critic, brought to the US at the age
          of 3. After studying composition with Copland and Sessions as a teenager he went to Paris
          to study with Nadia Boulanger (1927–31).</p>
        <p>During the 1930s Citkowitz also published music criticism in <title level="j">Modern
            Music</title> and <title level="j">Musical Mercury</title>. Among his prose pieces was
          the first English-language introduction to Schenker's ideas, <title level="a">The Role of
            Heinrich Schenker.</title> According to Milton Babbitt:</p>
        <p><!--bq start-->"... Schenker entered our lives at almost exactly the same time as
          Schoenberg entered our country, and from a most unexpected source: an article in the
          magazine Modern Music (!) by Israel Citkowitz, already well known as one of Nadia
          Boulanger's protégés, who was even viewed as the possible successor to Aaron Copland in
          the American compositional hierarchy. This article was not a detailed exposition of
          Schenkerian analysis but an understanding, appreciative presentation of what Citkowitz
          termed 'Schenker's lifelong consecration to the music of the Masters.'"<!--bq end--></p>
        <p>Hans Weisse wrote to Schenker, asking him if he had looked at Citkowitz's article,
          probably having heard that it had been brought to his attention by Manfred Willfort, and
          that Schenker had even sent it on to Jonas (see OJ 15/18, 32; OJ 12/6, [27]; OJ 5/18, 33].
          He also reported to Schenker that Citkowitz was studying with him: "I mark it down as the
          jackpot of this year that your theory has opened up a breach in the battlefront of
          radical-modernist American youth. This is a very promising beginning." (Weisse to
          Schenker, March 15, 1934, OJ 15/16, [94])</p>
        <p>In 1939, Citkowitz was appointed teacher of counterpoint and composition at the Dalcroze
          School in New York City, but informal accounts attest to his activity as a teacher of
          piano and Schenkerian theory and analysis throughout the 1930s. Among his students were
          the composer-pianist Leo Smit, and later, the conductor-pianist Richard Kapp.</p>
        <p>It was during the 1930s that <ref cRef="entity-000927">Arthur Waldeck</ref> studied
          Schenker with Citkowitz, allegedly at Carnegie Hall, according to Waldeck's son (who also
          claimed that <ref cRef="entity-000649">Ernst Oster</ref> joined in these studies after his
          arrival in the US in 1938). By 1948, Citkowitz had moved into his Carnegie Hall studio
          after a divorce. At around the same time, Arthur Waldeck's correspondence with Oswald
          Jonas indicates that he was teaching voice in a Carnegie Hall studio as well. Thus, it
          seems likely that the Citkowitz–Waldeck discussions of Schenker went on through the
          1930s, the War, and beyond. Though Citkowitz never worked with Leon Fleischer, his
          daughter says that his knowledge of piano technique led him to predict years in advance
          that Fleischer would develop problems with his hands.</p>
        <p>There is no correspondence between Citkowitz and Schenker.</p>
