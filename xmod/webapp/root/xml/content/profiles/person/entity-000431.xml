      <div>
        <p>Hungarian pianist and music educator. Kestenberg studied piano with
          Kullak and Busoni, embarked on a career as a concert pianist and taught at the Stern and
          Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatories in Berlin.</p>
        
        <p>In 1918, Kestenberg became music adviser to the Prussian Ministry of Science, Culture and
          Education, and in 1922 Director of the music department of the Zentralinstitut
          für Erziehung und Unterricht (Central Institute for Education and Instruction) in
          Berlin. His <title level="m">Musikerziehung und Musikpflege</title> (Music Education and the
          Cultivation of Music) (Leipzig, 1921, 2/1927), <title level="m">Schulmusikunterricht in
            Preussen</title> (School Music Instruction in Prussia) (Berlin, 1927) and several other
          books expressed his reforming ideas about music education, many of which were incorporated
          into government policies. In the 1930s, he and <ref cRef="entity-000809">Georg Schünemann</ref> were involved in
          reforming every aspect of music education in Prussia. He played a role also in the
          development of Gebrauchsmusik, declaring that it was "artistically as important as, and
          nowadays materially more promising than, concert music."</p>
        
        <p>As a Jew, he left Germany for Prague in 1934, and in 1938 moved to Tel Aviv, where he
          became general manager of the Palestine Symphony Orchestra while continuing his
          music-educational work.</p>
