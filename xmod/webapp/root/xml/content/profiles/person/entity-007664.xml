        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Alfred Hertz was born in Frankfurt am Main in 1872. He established a career as a
          conductor in Europe, but also performed in the USA, where he conducted at the New York
          Metropolitan Opera for the first time in 1902. Noted for his interpretations of Wagner's
          music, he broke the ban on performances of <title level="m">Parsifal</title> outside of
          Bayreuth by performing the work at the Met in 1903.</p>

        <p> Hertz was appointed conductor of the San Francisco Orchestra in 1915. He held that post
          until 1930, after which he continued as a guest conductor. He died in San Francisco in
          1942 aged 69. The University of California, Berkeley commemorated him with its Alfred
          Hertz Memorial Concert Hall.</p>

        <p>Hertz is remembered today for recordings of music from <title level="m">Parsifal</title>
          that he made in Berlin on the Deutsche Grammophon label with the Berlin Philharmonic
          Orchestra in 1913 and in San Francisco on the Victor label between 1925 and 1928.</p>

        <head>Hertz and the Schenker Circle</head>
        <p>Hertz's name is mentioned several times in 1938 and 1939 in the correspondence between
            <ref cRef="entity-000798">Arnold Schoenberg</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000913">Moriz
            Violin</ref>, as someone who might help <ref cRef="entity-000913">Violin</ref> secure a
          job in San Francisco. <ref cRef="entity-000798">Schoenberg</ref> wrote to Hertz on behalf
          of <ref cRef="entity-000913">Violin</ref>, but nothing apparently came of this.</p>
