        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Baron Dr. Erwin von Ferstel was the grandson of Ignaz Ferstel, head cashier of the
          Austrian National Bank. His parents were Charlotte Fehlmayer and the well known Viennese
          architect Heinrich von Ferstel, who played an important part in the rebuilding of Vienna
          in the mid-19th century. The latter was elevated to hereditary baronial status by the
          Emperor in 1879.</p>

        <p>From 1884, Erwin von Ferstel was employed by the Foreign Office of the Austria-Hungary
          monarch. In 1896 he was nominated to the rank of Consul. In this capacity, he served first
          in London, then from 1902 in Berlin. In 1901 he was accorded the title of General Consul
          Second Class, and in 1910 he was promoted to General Consul First Class. From 1920 to 1923
          he served on the Governing Board of the Bank of Liechtenstein. Ferstel was married to
          Marie Charlotte <ref cRef="entity-003212">Thorsch</ref>, with whom he had four
          children.</p>

        <p>Ferstel's address c. 1901 was Vienna I, Zedlitzgasse 8, in 1911‒14 Vienna III, <ref
            cRef="entity-002277">Reisnerstraße</ref> 55‒57, and in 1916‒20 Reisnerstraße 40 (which
          happens to have been next door to Schenker's apartment house!).</p>

        <head>Ferstel and Schenker</head>
        <p>Ferstel appears in Schenker's diary for <ref type="diaries" cRef="OJ-01-06_1907-04:r0013"
            >May 17, 1907</ref>: "Visit by Baron Erwin Ferstel to my place regarding the 400 florins
          requested for <ref cRef="entity-000913">Floriz</ref>." What ensued on that visit was a
          furious argument about the nature of patronage. This may have arisen out of Schenker's
          contact with the family of Ferstel's wife during 1906 and early 1907. On April 17, 1907 he
          discovered that Mrs. Thorsch's foundation had just donated 300,000 florins to the care of
          wealthy elderly people, and had "cut adrift" Violin: he was incensed. It would have not
          have been out of character for Schenker to communicate his anger to the family, and this
          may have occasioned the visit and argument.</p>
