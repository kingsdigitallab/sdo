      <head>Helga Schenker</head>
      <div>

        <p>Daughter of <ref cRef="entity-000774">Moriz [Mozio] Schenker</ref>, niece of Heinrich
          Schenker; graphic artist. </p>

        <p>Helga Schenker was the daughter of Heinrich Schenker's younger brother, Moriz and his
          wife Lisl. Her brother was <ref cRef="entity-000769">Georg Schenker</ref>. Helga was born
          in Egypt, later moved to Rumania, then to <ref cRef="entity-002394">Baden bei Wien</ref>,
          as dictated by her father's postings with the Austrian Provincial Bank. She later became a
          graphic artist and book- and newspaper-illustrator with her business partner Antoinette
          Langer. She (as a half-Jewess on her father's side and not on the more indicative mother's
          side) and Langer were permitted by the Nazis to maintain their atelier and continue
          working throughout World War II. Part-corroboration for this exists in the Vienna street
          directories, where her atelier is listed from 1935 to 1941 as Vienna I, Singerstraße 8,
          and her residence as Vienna III, Sechskrügelgasse 1. Later in life she gave up the latter
          address and converted her Singerstraße top-floor studio into an apartment, where she lived
          until shortly before her death in 2005. </p>

        <head>Helga and Heinrich Schenker</head>
        <p>The first reference in Schenker's diary comes on April 3, 1907: "News of the birth of a
          girl to Mozio" (OJ 1/6, p. 37) ‒ the information having taken three weeks to travel from
          Egypt. Heinrich and Jeanette must certainly have met Helga many times on family visits,
          although she is not named in the diary on such occasions. There is a reference to her,
          along with her brother, in Schenker's diary for June 13, 1924: "For the first time, Mozio
          speaks about his boy Georg, his musical talent, as well as about the talent of his
          daughter." (OJ 3/6, p. 2679).</p>
