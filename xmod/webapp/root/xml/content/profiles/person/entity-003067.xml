      <div>

        <p>Daughter of <ref cRef="entity-000774">Moriz Schenker</ref>, niece of Heinrich Schenker;
          graphic artist. </p>

        <p>Helga Schenker was the daughter of Heinrich Schenker's younger brother, Moriz and his
          wife Lisl. Her brother was <ref cRef="entity-000769">George Schenker</ref>. Helga was born
          in Egypt, later moved to Rumania, then to <ref cRef="entity-002394">Baden bei Wien</ref>,
          as dictated by her father's postings with the Austrian Provincial Bank. She later became a
          graphic artist and book- and newspaper-illustrator. From 1935 to 1941 her business is
          listed in the Vienna street directory as Vienna I, Singerstraße 8, and her residence as
          Vienna III, Sechskrügelgasse 1. </p>

        <p>There is no known contact between Helga and Heinrich, though it is likely that Heinrich
          and Jeanette visited Moriz's family and encountered her. There is a reference to Helga,
          along with her brother, in Schenker's diary for June 13, 1924: "For the first time, Mozio
          speaks about his boy Georg, his musical talent, as well as about the talent of his
          daughter." (OJ 3/6, p. 2679).</p>
