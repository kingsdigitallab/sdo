        <p>Grand Admiral of the German Navy and Secretary of State of the German Imperial Naval
          Office before and during World War I.</p>

        <p> Having joined the Prussian Navy in 1865 and worked his way through the ranks, becoming a
          Rear Admiral in 1895, Tirpitz spearheaded the build-up of the German Navy prior to World
          War I with a view to making Germany the greatest naval power in the world, and identifying
          England as Germany's prime enemy. In 1911, he was made a Grand Admiral and Secretary of
          State of the German Imperial Naval Office. In 1917, he was co-founder of the pan-Germanic
          German Fatherland Party, and after 1918 supported the German National People's Party,
          serving as a member of the Reichstag from 1924 to 1928. </p>
