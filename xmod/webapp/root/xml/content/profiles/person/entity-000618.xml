      <head>Siegfried Fritz Müller</head>
      <div>

        <p>Austrian pianist; pupil of Schenker's between October 1922 and May 1925.</p>

        <p>Siegfried Fritz Müller was a nephew of <ref cRef="entity-000119">Friedrich Siegfried
            Buxbaum</ref> (principal cellist of the Vienna Philharmonic, State Opera, and cellist of
          the Rosé String Quartet: diary: October 9, 1922), and son of <ref cRef="entity-000617"
            >Professor Paul Müller</ref> and Olga (<hi rend="italic">née</hi> Buxbaum). He had his
          first lesson with Schenker on October 12, 1922. Schenker thought well enough of him to
          recommend him for a position on July 18, 1923. The lessonbook for 1923/24 records no
          lessons, but in the 1924/25 season he resumed instruction, taking twelve lessons between
          April 8 and May 2, 1925, during which he worked on several compositions by Chopin,
          including the B minor Sonata, and also the Brahms Paganini Variations ‒ this is
          anticipated in Schenker's diary for September 23, 1924: "he will definitely come in the
          spring to work through a set program," and the lessons are commented on in Schenker's 1925
          diary. </p>

        <p>Müller gave solo recitals and evidently did some conducting. He subscribed to three
          copies of Schenker's <title level="j">Der Tonwille</title>, and evidently taught his
          pupils from it. He appears frequently in Schenker's diary, though in view of the common
          last name it is not always clear whether it is he who is referred to.</p>

        <head>Correspondence with Heinrich Schenker</head>
        <p>Six letters from Siegfried Fritz to Schenker are known to survive: OJ 12/59 (5: 1922–24)
          and OC 52/639 (1925); and one from his father Paul to Schenker: OJ 12/58 (1923). One
          letter from him to Oswald Jonas and Felix Salzer as editors of <ref cRef="entity-006065"
              ><title level="j">Der Dreiklang</title></ref> survives as OJ 36/188 (1937).</p>
