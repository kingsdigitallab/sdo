        <p>The name Thorsch is mentioned four times in Schenker's diary for 1906 and 1907. It would
          seem that Schenker was trying to obtain financial support for his friend <ref
            cRef="entity-000913">Moriz Violin</ref> (Floriz). He was at the Thorschs' home on
          December 19, 1906, January 5 (a quartet evening) and April 10, 1907, and then on April 17,
          1907 wrote in his diary: "The donation by Mrs. Thorsch (the second one) of 300,000 florins
          arouses in me indirectly some agitation: How unjust is such humanity directly against poor
          Floriz! What folly in the mentality of the woman to care so splendidly for 70-year-old men
          and women within her own circle, and by comparison to cut adrift financially a still very
          young artist who is suffering so severely in body and talent!" (OJ 1/5, p. 30; OJ 1/6, pp.
          32, 37, 38).</p>
