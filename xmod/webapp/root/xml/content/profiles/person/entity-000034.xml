      <head>Carl Bamberger</head>

      <div>
        <p>Conductor and writer on music. Born in Vienna; pupil of Schenker's.</p>

        <head>Career Summary</head>

        <p>Bamberger embarked on study of music and philosophy at the University of Vienna, but
          abandoned this in 1924 to take up the position of assistant conductor at the Danzig opera
          house (1924-27), from where he moved to the Darmstadt Landestheater (1927-30), thereafter
          to Russia (1931-35). In 1936, he married the violinist Lotte (Marie Charlotte)
          Hammerschlag, who studied with <ref cRef="entity-000754">Felix Salzer</ref> in the newly
          founded Schenker-Institut at the <ref cRef="entity-002451">Neues Wiener
            Konservatorium</ref> in 1935/36.</p>

        <p>Bamberger emigrated to the USA in 1937, where he became director of the orchestral and
          opera departments of the <ref cRef="entity-002454">David Mannes Music School</ref>, New
          York, from 1938 or 1939 (among others, Carl Schachter studied conducting with him there).
          His wife was professor of chamber music at the Mannes School, and his sister, Gerty
          Bamberger, who had also studied with Salzer at the Neues Wiener Konservatorium in 1935/36,
          and who was later to become the second wife of <ref cRef="entity-000989">Viktor
            Zuckerkandl</ref>, taught ear-training there. Bamberger established himself as a
          conductor in the USA and Canada, and was also a notable photographer.</p>

        <head>Bamberger and Schenker</head>

        <p>Bamberger studied with Schenker for four years, from Fall 1920 to June 1924, undertaking
          courses of study in counterpoint (1920/21) and thoroughbass (1921/22), and working
          analytically mostly on the orchestral repertory, also studying piano. In July 1933
          Schenker appealed to <ref cRef="entity-000577">Josef Marx</ref> (OeNB H Autogr.856/20/5)
          to intercede with <ref cRef="entity-003836">Oswald Kabasta</ref> to have Bamberger’s
          performances relayed on <ref cRef="entity-002755">Radio Wien</ref>, saying that Bamberger
          was already heard on the radio stations of Danzig, Königsberg and Darmstadt. Schenker drew
          attention to Bamberger’s performances of "early music."</p>
