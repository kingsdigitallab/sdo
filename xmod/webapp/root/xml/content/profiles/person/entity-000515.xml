      <head>Marianne Leibl</head>
      <div>

        <p>Pupil of Schenker’s in spring of 1924.</p>

        <p>Miss Leibl came to Schenker‘s attention with a recommendation from <ref
            cRef="entity-000655">Evelina Pairamall</ref>. The connection began inauspiciously: <cit>
            <q><ref cRef="entity-000201">Miss Elias</ref> shows us the letter from Marianne Leibl
              addressed to <ref cRef="entity-000416">Miss Kahn</ref>. The case is becoming peculiar,
              inasmuch as the lady actually has a recommendation from <ref cRef="entity-000655">Mrs.
                Pairamall</ref>, and so could have dispensed with a second recommendation. The
              question of the fee seems to be decisive. Noticeable at any rate is the tactlessness
              with which she, coming from a Mrs. Langhan (in Munich) countenances first making sure
              what kind of instruction it is before she will come to me. Through Miss Elias I have
              assigned Miss Kahn not to be plaintive but, in a manner consistent with her own
              dignity, to give the lady the brush-off. (Schenker’s diary, February 12, 1924)</q>
          </cit>
        </p>

        <p>“Mrs. Langhan,” <ref cRef="entity-003432">Anna Hirzl-Langenhan</ref>, was a former pupil
          of <ref cRef="entity-000523">Leschetizky</ref>, from whom Leibl had previously had
          lessons. Leibl started with Schenker in March 1924 and continued, with a gap between
          mid-April and mid-May, through to June. In November 1924 a dispute arose between <ref
            cRef="entity-000655">Mrs. Pairamall</ref> and the pianist and teacher Eduard Schütt over
          Miss Leibl (diary, November 6, 1924), as a result of which the lessonbook for 1924/25
          shows no signs of her having resumed lessons in the October.</p>

        <p>A Marianne Leibl (1871–1942) was transported from Vienna to <ref cRef="entity-007490"
            >Theresienstadt</ref> (Terezín) (transport IV/4, no. 502) and from there to Treblinka on
          September 21, 1942 (Bp, no. 1551), where she perished. No identity between the two women
          can be established.</p>
