      <head>Joseph Stritzko</head>
      <div>
        <p>Viennese music publisher.</p>
        <p> Joseph Stritzko had his own publishing company, located at Vienna I, Hoher Markt 3,
          which existed c.1890-1929, from 1912 on under the proprietorship of Carl Sutter. He was
          also a director of the printing firm J. Eberle &amp; Co.</p>

        <head>Stritzko and Schenker</head>
        <p>Stritzko evidently made an initial approach to Schenker sometime before September 11,
          1906, perhaps under the auspices of J. Eberle, although Doblinger was involved as well,
          about a prospective table of instruments. To this, Schenker responded with a letter and
          then a visit at which verbal agreement was reached (OJ 1/5, p. 19). However, negotiations
          deadlocked over the royalty a few days later, and the contract was canceled on September
          24. Schenker refers to the matter retrospectively in <ref type="correspondence"
            cRef="OJ-5-16_2">OJ 5/16, [2]</ref> (December 25, 1908) and <ref type="correspondence"
            cRef="WSLB-33">WSLB 33</ref> (December 31, 1908?). The <ref cRef="entity-001729">
              ><title level="m">Instrumentations-Tabelle</title>
          </ref> was later published by <ref cRef="entity-002408">Universal Edition</ref>. </p>
        <p>No correspondence between Stritzko and Schenker is known to survive, but some traces of
          it are recorded in his diaries.</p>
