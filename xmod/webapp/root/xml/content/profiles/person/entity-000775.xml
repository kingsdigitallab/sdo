      <head>Wilhelm Schenker</head>
      <div>
        <p>Third child--first surviving child--of <ref cRef="entity-000772">Johann</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000773">Julia</ref> Schenker, hence Heinrich Schenker's elder brother, who
          became a medical doctor. His wife's first name was <ref cRef="entity-000767">Dodi</ref>,
          and they had a number of children, perhaps the oldest being <ref cRef="entity-000766">Anton
          [Tonschl]</ref>. The couple lived in <ref cRef="entity-002301">Kautzen</ref>, where they cared
          for Julia Schenker for the last three years of her life (1914â€“17). </p>
        <p>Wilhelm does not appear to be mentioned in Schenker's diary before 1914, when Heinrich
          comments that Wilhelm is due to take his pension in 1915. Wilhelm--like Moriz, the
          youngest child--was relatively well-off, and he figures in Schenker's diary as providing
          money to Julia (OJ 1/15, pp. 677, 679, September 1 and 3, 1914), and in 1918 is involved
          with funeral and grave-stone arrangements for Julia.</p>

        <head>Correspondence with Heinrich and Jeanette</head>
        <p>Eight letters from Wilhelm to Heinrich and his wife Jeanette are known to survive as OJ
          14/6 (1930-39) and two as OC 44/38 and A/296 (1934), and 106 letters and postcards from
          Heinrich to Wilhelm as OJ 5/38. Wilhelm maintained contact with Jeanette after Heinrich's
          death, his last surviving letter to her being dated June 1, 1939 (OJ 14/6, [8]).</p>
