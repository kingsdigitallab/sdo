      <head>Evelina [Eveline] Pairamall</head>
      <div>
        <p>Pupil of Schenker's from at the latest January 17, 1912 (there is no mention of her in
          Schenker's diary before 1912) to at least 1932 and probably until Schenker's death.</p>

        <p>According to Schenker, she was a wealthy Polish Jew and owned "twenty-seven or
          twenty-nine [...] properties and houses in and around <ref cRef="entity-002372"
          >Lodz</ref>" (diary: OJ 1/15, p. 666, Aug 26, 1914). Schenker's antipathy toward the rich
          in society caused him frequently to voice harsh criticism of her, as of other rich pupils
          of his. She was, however, useful to Schenker on occasions in drawing his attention to
          items of interest and giving him useful presents. In 1919, when Schenker was intending to
          move to Germany, she was the first pupil to declare that she would go with him – but,
          Schenker remarks, "only after I had thrown her out on account of her sordid attitude
          toward money and other matters" (OJ 6/6, [10], Aug 17, 1919). </p>

        <p>She also took some lessons from Hans Weisse in 1921 (OJ 15/16, [45]). By 1929 she was
          suffering from ill-health and went into a sanatorium. There the Schenkers visited her on
          November 28, 1929, on which visit she claimed precedence "in the matter of autograph
          manuscripts" [i.e. the <ref cRef="entity-002452">Photogrammarchiv</ref>], and expressed
          resentment at Schenker for having given all the credit to <ref cRef="entity-000380"
            >Hoboken</ref>.</p>

        <p>She was enrolled at the newly-founded Schenker-Insitut at the Neues Wiener Konservatorium
          in 1935/36, at which time she was living at Vienn III, Neulinggasse 16/6 (very close to
          Schenker's Reisnerstraße apartment). Apparently she returned to Lodz in 1938. Nothing more
          is known of her.</p>

        <head>Correspondence with Schenker</head>
        <p>There are two letters from Schenker to Pairamall: OJ 5/27 (November 12, 1913) and OC 1B/5
          (September 9, 1916, which is written by Jeanette in a system of shorthand known as
          "Gabelsberger" Kurzschrift).</p>
