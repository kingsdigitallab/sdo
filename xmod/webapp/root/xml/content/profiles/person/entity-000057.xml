      <head>Paul Bekker</head>
      <div>
        <p>German music critic and writer on music, and on social and aesthetic issues, who served
          as highly influential music critic of the <title level="j">Frankfurter Zeitung</title>
          1911-25, and was author of a monograph on <title level="m">Beethoven</title> (1911).</p>

        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Bekker studied violin in Berlin and began his career as an orchestral violinist and
          conductor. In 1906, he became music critic for the Berlin <title level="j">Neueste
            Nachrichten</title> and in 1909 for the <title level="j">Berliner Allgemeine
          Zeitung</title>. He moved to Frankfurt in 1911, and became chief critic for the <title level="j">Frankfurter Zeitung</title>, in which capacity he was an advocate for new
          music (especially that of Mahler, Hindemith, Schoenberg, Schreker, Weill, and Krenek), and
          wrote about the theory of music criticism. He later took posts in the state theaters of
          Kassel (1925) and Wiesbaden (1927-33), before emigrating to New York in 1934 and resuming
          his work as a critic there.</p>
        <p>Bekker wrote biographies on Oskar Fried (1907), Offenbach (1909), Beethoven (1911), Liszt
          (1912), Schreker (1919), and Wagner (1924), a study of Mahler's symphonies (1921), a
          history of the orchestra (1936), several books on opera, a study of German musical life
          (1916), and other topics.</p>

        <head>Bekker and Schenker</head>
        <p>During the period 1913-23, an animosity existed between Bekker and Schenker so sharp that
          it may even have damaged Schenker's relationships with his principal publisher, Universal
          Edition. Schenker criticized Bekker for the first time in the "Secondary Literature"
          sections of <title level="m">Die letzten fünf Sonaten von Beethoven ... op.
          109</title> (1913), pp. 55-6; <title level="m">op. 110</title> (1914), pp. 83-4;
            <title>op. 111</title> (1915), pp. 93-5; <title level="m">op. 101</title> (1920), pp.
          79-81. He took Bekker to task for his espousal of hermeneutics ("why do [the
          hermeneuticists] besmirch the inimitably proud works of the masters with terminological
          excrement?"), his ignorance of technical musical matters ("Mr Bekker, who made himself out
          to be so well-versed in [the diminished-7th chord], failed to recognize it just because
          the chord happens to appear in a form other than that in the textbooks"), and his advocacy
          of modern music (<title level="m">op. 111</title>, p. 94). Bekker reviewed these volumes
          unfavorably in the UE house-journal <title level="j">Musikblätter des
          Anbruch</title>.</p>

        <p>After years of silence, Bekker came out in 1922 with a broadside against Schenker ("[the
          combining of aesthetics with music theory] has been attempted on several occasions,
          sometimes in a doctrinaire manner as, for example, by Heinrich Schenker, whose method of
          measuring and counting has been prized by many as a learned approach") in a review of
          Ernst Kurth's <title level="m">Harmonielehre</title>. A month later, he reviewed
          Schenker's facsimile edition of Beethoven's <ref cRef="entity-001754">"Moonlight" Sonata</ref> with the stinging reference
          to: "superfluous and sterile introductions by editors [...] such as the ridiculous
          comments by Schenker on Beethoven's autograph along with his 'Urlinie.' If such personal
          expectorations have to be published at all, then at least they are out-of-place in this
          context, and actually spoil the impression of such a publication."</p>

        <p>Schenker cut part of his remarks on Bekker for <title level="m">Op. 101</title> (1920) at
          proof stage, and sought to include them, together with a response to the "Moonlight"
          facsimile and Kurth reviews, in the "Miscellanea" of <title level="j">Tonwille 2</title>
          (1922). However, Hertzka declined to publish this material (OC 52/566, May 3, 1922; OC
          52/312-313: May 19, 1922), Bekker being a personal friend and a public supporter of UE's
          modern music publishing. (The complete text suppressed from <title level="j">Tonwille
          2</title> is available in the English translation under Schenker's own title of
          "Musikkritik.") Subsequently, Schenker quoted <hi rend="italic">in extenso</hi> a passage
          from Bekker's <title level="m">Beethoven</title> (1911) regarding the first movement of
          the Fifth Symphony, with the concluding comment: "Now what would this phrase-monger have
          offered about the content of the first movement, had he known nothing of the legend?"
            <title level="m">Tonwille 5</title> (1923), p. 31, Eng. trans., I, p. 201).</p>

        <p>No correspondence between Schenker and Bekker is known to exist.</p>
