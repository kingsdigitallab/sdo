        <p>Hausmann studied with Theodor Muller at the Braunschweig Gymnasium 1861 to c.1868, then became one of the first students at the newly opened Berlin Musikhochschule[entity-002800] in 1869, studying under Joachim[entity-000404], the under Piatti in London and Cadenabbia. From 1872 to 1876 he was the cellist of the Hochberg Quartet in Dresden, during which period he was appointed as teacher of cello at the Berlin Hochschule. From 1879 to 1907 he was the cellist of the Joachim Quartet. </p>
        
        <p>His association with the composer led to Brahms[entity-000094] writing his Cello Sonata No. 2, Op. 99 for him, and to Hausmann playing the world premieres of several of his works, including the Second Cello Sonata (with Brahms), the Clarinet Trio in A minor, Op. 114 (with Richard MÃ¼hlfeld and Brahms), and the Double Concerto in A minor, Op. 102 (with Joachim).</p>
