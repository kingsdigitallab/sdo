        <p>Greta Kraus was a student of Hans Weisse and member of a seminar conducted by Weisse
          prior to his emigration to New York in September 1931. At the start of the 1931/32 season,
          she became a member of Schenker's "<ref cRef="entity-002499">Friday Seminar</ref>" with
            <ref cRef="entity-000473">Trude Kral</ref>, <ref cRef="entity-000754">Felix
          Salzer</ref>, and <ref cRef="entity-000964">Manfred Willfort</ref>. </p>

        <p>She appears in Schenker's set of lesson notes for the seminar (October 9, 1931 to May 23,
