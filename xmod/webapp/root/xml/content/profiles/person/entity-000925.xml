        <p>Wahle figures in Schenker's diary as early as 1906, when he is mentioned together with
          Eduard Gärtner (OJ 1/5, p. 21) and 1907 (OJ 1/6, p. 35: "Evening: played with
          Fritz, etc. and [Moriz] Violin at the Rudolfinerhaus.") and p. 37 ("After quartet at
          Gärtner's, Kapellmeister Kunwald, Fritz, and Floriz in the coffee-house:
          discussion of Brahms's epigonism."). In 1909, Schenker asked UE to send Wahle a
          complimentary copy of the second edition of his <title level="m">Beitrag zur
          Ornamentik</title> (WSLB 43), and in 1910 of his edition of the <title level="m">Chromatic
            Fantasy and Fugue</title> (WSLB 66/67), in which years he was living at Vienna I,
          Börsegasse 7 or 9.</p>

        <p>Schenker offers an encomium on his death:
          
          <cit><q>Fritz Wahle has died! Even if in the specific sense of the word he is not to be ranked
          highly as a musician, he was driven by yearning for the highest standards, namely toward
          the example of [Joseph] Joachim, and that and his unusual literary education (fondness for Jean
          Paul [Richter]) gave him a particular stamp as a man, yes, something that can be called personality.
          On the basis of this he was able to enliven and stimulate every social gathering he
          attended. I myself stood in his debt for years of most happy experiences, for felicitous
          music-making, for memories of our delightful adventures and ultimately for my acquaintance
          with his brother, the university professor, to whom my sister in particular owes a great
          deal. ( diary OJ 2/11, pp. 923-924, July 24, 1918)</q></cit> </p>
