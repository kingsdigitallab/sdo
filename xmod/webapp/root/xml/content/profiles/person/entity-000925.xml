        <head>Wahle and Schenker</head>

        <p>Wahle figures in Schenker's diary as early as 1903, as a member of the “<ref
            cRef="entity-000274">Gärtner</ref> Quartet” (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-6-4_23"
            >OJ 6/4, [23]</ref>, February 16, 1903), and again in 1906, when he is mentioned
          together with <ref cRef="entity-000274">Eduard Gärtner</ref> (p. 21) and 1907 (p. 35:
          "Evening: played with Fritz, etc. and <ref cRef="entity-000913">[Moriz] Violin</ref> at
          the <rs key="entity-003277" type="place">Rudolfinerhaus</rs>.") and p. 37 ("After quartet
          at <ref cRef="entity-000274">Eduard Gärtner</ref>'s, Kapellmeister <ref
            cRef="entity-003308">Kunwald</ref>, Fritz, and <ref cRef="entity-000913">Floriz</ref> in
          the coffee-house: discussion of Brahms's epigonism."). In 1909, Schenker asked <ref
            cRef="entity-002408">Universal Edition</ref> to send Wahle a complimentary copy of the
          second edition of his <title level="m">Beitrag zur Ornamentik</title> (<ref
            type="correspondence" cRef="WSLB-43">WSLB 43</ref>), and in 1910 of his edition of the
            <title level="m">Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue</title> (<ref type="correspondence"
            cRef="WSLB-66-67">WSLB 66/67</ref>), in which years he was living at Vienna I,
          Börsegasse 7 or 9.</p>

        <p>Schenker offers an encomium on his death: <cit>
            <q>Fritz Wahle has died! Even if in the specific sense of the word he is not to be
              ranked highly as a musician, he was driven by yearning for the highest standards,
              namely toward the example of [Joseph] Joachim, and that and his unusual literary
              education (fondness for Jean Paul [Richter]) gave him a particular stamp as a man,
              yes, something that can be called personality. On the basis of this he was able to
              enliven and stimulate every social gathering he attended. I myself stood in his debt
              for years of most happy experiences, for felicitous music-making, for memories of our
              delightful adventures and ultimately for my acquaintance with his <ref
                cRef="entity-000926">brother</ref>, the university professor, to whom my <ref
                cRef="entity-000319">sister</ref> in particular owes a great deal. ( diary, pp.
              923-924, July 24, 1918)</q>
