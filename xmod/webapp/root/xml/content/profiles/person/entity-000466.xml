      <head>Emil Kornfeld</head>
      <div>
        <p>First husband of <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette Schenker</ref>.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Son of Ignatz Kornfeld and Charlotte Weissenstein, Emil Kornfeld was the first husband of
            <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette Schenker</ref> (known in the Kornfeld family as
          Jenny). Emil and Jeanette were married on July 30, 1893, and had two sons, <ref
            cRef="entity-000467">Erich</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000468">Felix</ref>. The family
          lived in <ref cRef="entity-002248">Aussig</ref> (Austria). Emil strenuously resisted
          Jeanette's petitions to secure a separation, and the annulment of their marriage did not
          take place until November 10, 1919.</p>

        <p>Little is known of Emil's firm, Klaber &amp; Kornfeld, but a page survives in Schenker's
          diary (OJ 1/10, p. 133 <hi rend="italic">verso</hi>, June 1911), with the printed
          letterhead: "Klaber &amp; Kornfeld | Aussig A. E. | - | Telegramm-Addresse | Klaber
          Kornfeld Aussig | Telefon No. 103 | Clearing-Verkehr: Ceck-Conto No. 27.999."</p>

        <p>It may perhaps have been a chemical manufacting company; both sons were involved in it,
          and possibly Jeanette, too, up to 1910.</p>

        <head>Emil Kornfeld and Schenker</head>
        <p>Emil and Heinrich were apparently close friends from some time in the early 1890s to
          1910, and between 1903 and 1908 they spent several summer holidays together, probably
          (certainly in 1908) including Jeanette. Jeanette left her husband and sons for Schenker on
          September 30, 1910, moving to Vienna. From that time all mention of her was forbidden by
          Emil, although Jeanette is known to have made attempts to contact her sons. Emil resisted
          petitions for separation on the part of Jeanette for at least seven years (the attorneys
          being Dr. Steinitz (for Jeanette), Dr. Hübsch, and Dr. Glassner), insisting that Jeanette
          return to him. Only after changes in the laws did Jeanette succeed: the petition was
          approved on November 10, 1919, and Heinrich and she married later the same day. </p>

        <p>No correspondence between Emil Kornfeld and Schenker is known to survive. However, one
          postcard exists among Schenker's papers: a picture postcard from Jenny Kornfeld to Moriz
          Violin, dated September 23, 1909 (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-7-4_54">OJ 7/4,
            [54]</ref>), which includes a postscript apparently in the hand of Emil. In Schenker's
          post-1910 diaries his name is coded as "Kfld." or "der Krämer" (the grocer) or "der
          Gegner" (the adversary). </p>
