      <div>
        <p>Pupil of Schenker's from April 1 1919 to the end of 1921. </p>
        <p>The first approach to Schenker regarding lessons for Fräulein Moscisker came from her
          father, Dr. Bernhard Moscisker, on March 7, 1919. She had been working with another
          teacher, and Schenker insisted on her terminating those lessons before he would take her
          on (diary March 14, 28, 1919). Schenker described her as "naïve and childlike" (Dec 5,
          1919), but as "musical" (March 7, 1919). </p>
        <p>She took only one lesson per week, and played standard repertory solo piano music. There
          is no evidence in the lessonbooks of the study of counterpoint or thoroughbass; indeed, on
          November 26, 1920, she asked for a counterpoint lesson and Schenker refused. The last
          contact with her appears to have been on December 2, 1921; cessation of lessons may have
          been occasioned by increases in Schenker's fee. </p>
        <p>There is no known correspondence between Moscisker and Schenker.</p>
