      <head>Sofie [Sophie] Deutsch</head>

      <div>
        <p>Wealthy Viennese-Jewish widow, sister of the industrialist <ref cRef="mendl_fritz">Fritz Mendl</ref>, long-term pupil
          of Schenker's.</p>

        <p>Sofie Deutsch was a pupil of Schenker's apparently from 1902 until her death (when she is
          described as having been "a pupil of 15 years' standing"), working mostly on piano
          repertory (Beethoven, Chopin, Brahms) and keyboard parts of piano trios and quartets. She
          was also one of Schenker's principal patrons. Schenker was frequently to be seen having
          meals with her in the coffee house, and spending evenings at her home with a circle of
          guests in elevated conversation (meticulously, sometimes scornfully, recorded in
          Schenker's diary) or playing chamber-music. Schenker was always trying to improve her,
          lecturing her on matters of morality, commending improving reading to her. He once
          described her as "An eternally restless person, sinking into the dirt over and over again,
          a genuine Hedda Gabler character" (OJ 1/7, p. 74, November 2, 1908).</p>

        <p>In her will, she settled on Schenker an annual pension of 2,000 Kronen to be paid in
          half-yearly instalments, and an outright legacy of 5,000 Kronen (OJ 12/52, January 12,
          1917). Her benefaction made possible the publishing of Schenker's <ref
            cRef="kontrapunkt_2">
            <title level="m">Kontrapunkt 2</title>
          </ref>. She also left money to provide stipends for "impecunious skilled composers and
          similarly qualified composition pupils," of which Schenker was to be the sole life-long
          arbiter, awarding two per year. This money constituted a quarter of a sum willed to a
          charity in which she was involved, the <ref cRef="verein_zur_speisung">Verein zur Speisung
            und Bekleidung hungernder Schulkinder in Wien</ref> (Association for Feeding and
          Clothing Schoolchildren in Vienna); after the Association was wound up in 1924, the
          stipends were transferred to the Vienna Akademie (Hochschule) f&#xFC;r Musik und
          Darstellende Kunst (=Conservatory) as the "Sophie Deutsch Music Stipend;" the transfer was
          hotly contested by Schenker, who preferred to allocate the stipends privately rather than
          through an institution (OC 5/24, July 8, 1924).</p>

        <head>Lesson Records and Correspondence</head>
        <p>Records of her lessons are recorded in Schenker's lessonbooks 1912/13-1916/17 (OC 3/1-3).
          Schenker's correspondence and encounters with her are extensively reported in the diaries
          from 1906 to her death. There is only one letter from her to Schenker (OJ 10/4, January
          26, 1916), in which she announces that she is settling on him 10,000 Marks in annual
          withdrawals of up to 3,000 Marks "for the purpose of publishing your future works," but
          there is much correspondence to and from Schenker with Fritz Mendl, and attorneys
          Siegfried T&#xFC;rkel (OJ 14/40; OC 1 B/23, 36; 10/6; 16/27-28, 30-31, 33, 36-40, 146), Ernst Lamberg (OJ 5/24, 12/31), and Hugo Friedmann (OC 1 B/19-20; 16/32).</p>

        <p>It was at her house that Schenker met Otto Erich Deutsch, who seems to have been unrelated to
          Sofie.</p>
