      <head>Georg Schenker</head>
      <div>

        <p>Son of <ref cRef="entity-000774">Moriz Schenker</ref>, nephew of Heinrich Schenker;
          cellist. </p>

        <p>Georg Schenker was the son of Heinrich Schenker's younger brother, Moriz and his wife
          Lisl. His sister was <ref cRef="entity-003067">Helga Schenker</ref>. He became a
          professional cellist and played with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra (Wiener Symphoniker)
          until the orchestra's disbanding in 1944. Between 1938 and 1944 the orchestra was nazified
          and co-opted for propaganda purposes ‒ despite being half-Jewish (Jewish on his deceased
          father's side but not on the more indicative mother's side), he was allowed to retain his
          seat. Part-corroboration for this exists in the Vienna street directories for 1941 and
          1942 (the final year of the directory), in which he is listed as "symphonic musician"
          living at Vienna III, Radetzkystraße 6. He apparently continued to live in Vienna until
          his death. </p>

        <head>Georg and Heinrich Schenker</head>
        <p>There is a reference to Georg Schenker in Schenker's diary for June 13, 1924: "For the
          first time, Mozio [i.e. Moriz] speaks about his boy Georg, his musical talent ..." (OJ
          3/6, p. 2679). On September 15, 1926, Schenker records: "At Mozio's, ... he tells us that
          his son has taken up a career in music – he wished, so he said, that he had told us about
          this before, but did not get around to it!" (OJ 3/8, p. 2977).</p>

        <p>Schenker's diaries show that he played with Georg on several occasions. Thus on December
          5, 1926 he "went through" the whole of Beethoven's Cello Sonata in A major, Op. 69 with
          Georg, commenting that "he proves himself thoroughly skilled" (OJ 3/9, p. 3007). On
          January 2, 1927 he played a Haydn E-flat-major piano trio and Beethoven's "Archduke" Trio
          with Georg and Moriz (the latter presumably on violin) (OJ 3/9, p. 3020). The two also
          played the first movement of a Brahms cello sonata on April 28, 1927, and again on May 22:
          "From 11 to 7:30 in Baden; play the first movement of the Brahms sonata with Georg, also
          Haydn four-hands" (OJ 3/9 , pp. 3060, 3069). </p>

        <p>Schenker agreed on November 16, 1927 to give Georg lessons (OJ 4/1, p. 3136), and the
          latter became a pupil on October 1, 1928, studying two- and three-voice
          counterpoint for the next two years, also piano (mainly Beethoven sonatas), and bringing
          his cello occasionally in order to work with Heinrich on the Haydn Cello Concerto (Dec 2,
          1929) and the Bach G-major Cello Suite (March 24‒April 28, 1930). No lessons are recorded
          in the lessonbook for 1930/31 or the notes for 1931/32, or in the table of lessons for
          1934/35, and he was not a member of the <ref cRef="entity-002499">Schenker Seminar</ref>. </p>

        <p>If there was any correspondence between Georg and Heinrich Schenker, it is not known to
          survive. </p>
