      <head>Georg Schenker</head>
      <div>

        <p>Son of <ref cRef="entity-000774">Moriz Schenker</ref>, nephew of Heinrich Schenker;
          cellist. </p>

        <p>Georg Schenker was the son of Heinrich Schenker's younger brother, Moriz and his wife
          Lisl. His sister was <ref cRef="entity-003067">Helga Schenker</ref>. He became a
          professional cellist and played with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra (Wiener Symphoniker)
          until the orchestra's disbanding in 1944. (Between 1938 and 1944 the orchestra was
          nazified and co-opted for propaganda purposes.) In 1941 and 1942 he is listed in the
          Vienna street directory as a "symphonic musician" living at Vienna III, Radetzkystraße 6.
          Nothing more is known of his life. </p>
      </div>

        <head>Georg and Heinrich Schenker</head>
        <p>There is a reference to Georg Schenker in Schenker's diary for June 13, 1924: "For the
          first time, Mozio [i.e. Moriz] speaks about his boy Georg, his musical talent ..." (OJ
          3/6, p. 2679).</p>

        <p>Georg became a pupil of Heinrich Schenker on October 1, 1928, studying two- and
          three-voice counterpoint for the next two years, also piano (mainly Beethoven sonatas),
          and bringing his cello occasionally in order to work with Heinrich on the Haydn Cello
          Concerto (December 2, 1929) and the Bach G-major Cello Suite (March 24‒April 28, 1930). No
          lessons are recorded in the lessonbook for 1930/31 or the notes for 1931/32, or in the
          table of lessons for 1934/35, and he was not a member of the Schenker Seminar. </p>

        <p>If there was any correspondence between Georg and Heinrich Schenker, it is not known to
          survive. </p>
