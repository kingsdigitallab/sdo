      <head>Ignaz Brüll</head>
      <div>

        <p>Austrian pianist and composer of Czech origin, friend and colleague of Schenker.</p>

        <div>
          <head>Career Summary</head>
          <p>Brüll studied piano (with <ref cRef="entity-000210">Julius Epstein</ref>) and
            composition in Vienna. In the early 1860s he began his rise to prominence as a composer,
            culminating in the successful performance of his opera <title level="m">The Golden
              Cross</title> in 1875. In all, he wrote nine operas, one ballet, orchestral works in
            several genres, two piano concertos and one violin concerto, and a large amount of
            chamber music, solo piano works, and choral and vocal works. He taught at the <ref
              cRef="entity-002450">Horák School of Music</ref> in Vienna 1872‒78, becoming one of
            its directors in 1881. He made several concert tours as a solo pianist, performing works
            from the classical and romantic repertory. He was a close friend of Brahms, who
            frequently entrusted him with first performances of his piano works.</p>

        <div>
          <head>Brüll and Schenker</head>
          <p>Schenker was part of the Brahms circle ‒ though much less intimately so than Brüll.
            (One might almost say that Brüll, and others such as <ref cRef="entity-000750">Ernst
              Rudorff</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000724">Julius Röntgen</ref>, belonged to the
            "intersection" of the Brahms and Schenker circles.) The period of personal contact
            between Schenker and Brüll coincided roughly with that in which Schenker was striving to
            establish himself as a composer. He showed his compositions to Brüll in visits and by
            mailing copies to him, and received favorable comments such as "bears the stamp of a
            deep spirit and significant talent" and "has an element of Sturm und Drang." His diary
            for February 7, 1897 records a visit to Brüll in which he received a "sincerely
            favorable judgment" on unspecified works. And Schenker received social invitations from
            Brüll and his wife.</p>

          <head>Correspondence</head>
          <p>Ten letters, a calling card, a note, and a printed concert announcement from Brüll to
            Schenker survive as OJ 9/23, [1]‒[11] and [A]‒[B] dating from 1891 to 1907.
            Additionally, two postcards from Brüll to Moriz Violin survive as OJ 70/9, [1]‒[2].
            Brüll seems not to have been mentioned in Schenker's critical writings and reviews from
            the years 1891 to 1901.</p>
