      <head>Ferruccio Busoni</head>
      <div>
        <p>Italian composer, virtuoso pianist (especially of Bach, Mozart, and Liszt), and
          aesthetician.</p>
      </div>

        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Busoni studied at the Vienna Conservatory (1875-77), in Graz, then in Leipzig (1885-88),
          thereafter teaching in Finland, Russia, and the US, before settling in Berlin in 1894,
          where he wrote his forward-looking book <title level="m">Entwurf einer neuen
            Ästhetik der Tonkunst</title> (Sketch for a New Aesthetic of Music, 1907). Although
          eschewing atonality in his own compositions, he took a keen interest in the music of
          Schoenberg, Bartók, Varèse, Hindemith, and others. His piano pupils included
          Egon Petri and Eduard Steuermann.</p>
        <p>During World War I, he lived in the US then in Switzerland, before returning to Berlin[?]
          after 1918. In addition to compositions such as the <title level="m">Fantasia
            contrappuntistica</title> (1910) and the operas <title level="m">Arlecchino</title>
          (1916), <title level="m">Turandot</title> (1917), and <title level="m">Doktor
          Faust</title> (1924), Busoni is well known for his transcriptions of and cadenzas for
          works by J. S. Bach, Beethoven, Liszt, Mozart, Schubert, and others. He edited the piano
          works of Liszt for Breitkopf &amp; Härtel. His edition of Bach's <title level="m">Well-tempered Clavier</title> (B&amp;H, 1894, 1916) was influential in its day, and
          commanded some respect on Schenker's part; in 1908, Universal Edition approached Schenker
          about supplying the edition of Book II, but he declined.</p>

        <head>Busoni and Schenker</head>
        <p>Schenker mentioned Busoni the pianist briefly in reviews from 1895 and 1896. The two men
          first became acquainted in 1897, Schenker writing a lengthy description of him in his
          diary for February 12 beginning "serious, perhaps even drab, . . embittered, ..
          industrious, oftentimes imposing - totally focused on matters artistic, though admittedly
          by the standards of present-day understanding. Original in his Bach transcriptions." (OJ
          1/1, p. 3).</p>
        <p>Busoni was one of several supporters of Schenker as a composer around 1900, and
          recommended Breitkopf &amp; Härtel to publish his <title level="m">Fantasie</title>,
          Op. 2 (1898/99 - dedicated to Busoni), which Busoni had admired as three separate
          compositions and recommended Schenker to "forge" together into a single work. Busoni
          admired Schenker's two-piano work <title level="m">Syrische Tänze</title> (1899) as
          "marvelous, full of atmosphere, secessionistic," and instigated Schoenberg's
          instrumentation of them (now lost), performed by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in
          Busoni's Orchester-Abende series in Berlin on October 19 and November 5, 1903 alongside
          works by d'Indy, Debussy, Berlioz, Franck, and Nielsen.</p>
        <p>In 1908, Schenker's diary speaks less favorably of him: "Busoni plays the Beethoven
          Choral Fantasy and Liszt's <title level="m">Totentanz</title> in his snakily fascinating,
          cold manner. [...] Busoni's paradoxicalities [are becoming] increasingly precipitous,
          increasingly abrupt--pernicious teaching of the young, what's more also pernicious example
          of life." (OJ 1/7, p. 64, January 15, 1908). In <ref cRef="entity-001726"><title level="m">Kontrapunkt 1</title></ref> (1910), he criticized Busoni's <title level="m">Entwurf</title>, along with other theorists, for calling for a return to the modes and to
          exotic scales as a means of "expanding our musical horizon" (p. 33; Eng. trans., p. 21).
          The two men drifted apart at about that time.</p>

        <head>Correspondence with Schenker</head>
        <p>Thirty-eight items of correspondence between Schenker and Busoni are known to survive: 22
          from Schenker to Busoni (1897-1903: Staatsbibliothek Berlin, B II, 4413-31, 3550, 14 of
          them duplicated as OJ 5/5a, photocopies), 16 from Busoni to Schenker (1897-1903: OJ 9/27,
          plus several transcripts), and in addition two items from Busoni to Moriz Violin (1900: OJ
          70/67, 71/6).</p>
