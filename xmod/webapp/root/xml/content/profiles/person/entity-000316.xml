      <head>Hans Guttmann</head>
      <div>
        <p>Elder son of Sophie and Salo Guttmann, brother of Frieda and Julien Guttmann, nephew of
          Heinrich and Jeanette Schenker.</p>

        <p>Hans Guttmann served in the Austrian-Hungarian army in World War I. After the war, he
          studied in Vienna with financial support from his uncle, <ref cRef="entity-000774">Moriz
            Schenker</ref>. He visited the Schenkers at their summer resort in <rs
            key="entity-002292" type="place">Galtür</rs> on August 29 to September 1, 1927, where he
          proved himself to be a photographer; and then stayed in Vienna September 8‒18, visiting
          them each day (diary OJ 3/9, pp. 3106‒3118). By 1934, he is known to have married Edith
          (who was said to have extravagant tastes (OJ 11/31, [1] and [2])), and to have a daughter
          (OC A/289). By 1939, he was based in Belgrade (OJ 11/31, [4]).</p>

          <p>One fragmentary letter from Hans Guttmann to Heinrich and Jeanette Schenker is
            preserved as OC 65/5 (1923). It is possible that some or all of the photograph OJ 72/15,
            No. 2‒4, showing Heinrich and Jeanette in a chauffeured car in Galtür, were those taken
            by Hans on September 1, 1927, as the Schenkers left Galtür,and delivered on September 10
            (OJ 3/9, pp. 3107, 3113). Photographs of Hans survive as OJ 72/18, Nos. 9, 10 (in
            military uniform), and he appears also in Nos. 8 and 13 with Frieda and Julien.</p>
