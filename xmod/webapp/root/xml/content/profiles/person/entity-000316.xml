      <div>
        <p>Elder son of <ref cRef="entity-000319">Sophie</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000318"
            >Salo</ref> Guttmann, brother of <ref cRef="entity-000315">Frieda</ref> and <ref
            cRef="entity-000317">Julien</ref> Guttmann, nephew of Heinrich and Jeanette Schenker,
          godson of Heinrich.</p>

        <p>In his diary for August 17, 1898, Schenker speaks of his being godfather to the
          "firstborn" (Hans) of his sister Sophie Guttman, expressing the hope the he will honour
          the name of his grandfather (<ref cRef="entity-000772">Johann Schenker</ref>).</p>

        <p>Hans Guttmann served in the Austrian-Hungarian army in World War I. After the war, he
          studied in Vienna with financial support from his uncle, <ref cRef="entity-000774">Moriz
            Schenker</ref>. He visited the Schenkers at their summer resort in <rs
            key="entity-002292" type="place">Galtür</rs> on August 29 to September 1, 1927, where he
          proved himself to be a photographer; and then stayed in Vienna September 8‒18, visiting
          them each day (diary OJ 3/9, pp. 3106‒3118). Hans married Edith (who was said to have
          extravagant tastes (OJ 11/31, [1] and [2])) on May 27, 1929 in Agram (Zagreb), Croatia
          (Schenker was invited but did not attend), and by 1934 the couple had a daughter (A/289).
          By 1939, he was based in Belgrade (OJ 11/31, [4]).</p>

          <p>One fragmentary letter from Hans Guttmann to Heinrich and Jeanette Schenker is
            preserved as OC 65/5 (1923). It is possible that some or all of the photographs OJ
            72/15, Nos 2‒4, showing Heinrich and Jeanette in a chauffeured car in Galtür, were those
            recorded in the diary as having been taken by Hans on September 1, 1927 as the Schenkers
            left Galtür,and delivered on September 10 (OJ 3/9, pp. 3107, 3113). Photographs of Hans
            survive as OJ 72/18, Nos 9, 10 (in military uniform), and he appears also in Nos 8 and
            13 with Frieda and Julien.</p>
