      <head>Paul von Hindenburg</head>

      <div>
        <p>German Field
          Marshal during World War I, and second President of the Weimar Republic (1925-34).</p>
        <p>Hindenburg had retired from military service in 1911, but was recalled in 1914 to serve
          nominally as superior officer to <ref cRef="entity-000544">Erich Ludendorff</ref>; promoted to Field Marshall in 1916 in
          charge of all German land forces, he rose to national heroic status--a regard that
          Schenker undoubtedly shared. Retired again in 1919, Hindenburg was elected President in
          1925 and for a second term in 1932. It was he who appointed Hitler Chancellor of Germany
          on January 30, 1933 (ironically an event that dashed Schenker's hopes of academic
          advancement).</p>

          <head>Correspondence between Hindenburg and Schenker</head>
        
        <p>Four draft letters from Schenker to Hindenburg are preserved (OC 24/14, 15, 16-17), and
          one handwritten reply from Hindenburg (OC 24/18). The first draft was intended to
          accompany a copy of <title level="j">Der Tonwille</title>, Heft 1 (1921). In the draft, he draws
          attention to the penultimate four pages of his lead article, <title level="a">The Mission of German
          Genius</title> (on an earlier page of which he made allusion to "the genius of those two
          time-honored generals, Hindenburg and Ludendorff"), and also to some additional pages, and
          seeks to discredit Universal Edition as "operating internationally." The second draft
          appears intended to accompany Hefts 1-3, drawing attention to the whole of the lead
          article, to the Miscellanea of Heft 1 (one section of which begins "If I were Secretary of
          State for the Arts in German-Austria, I would ..."), and also the highly politically
          polemical Miscellanea of Heft 3 (published January 19, 1923), and speaks of the role of
          art in politics.</p> 
          
          <p>While it is clear that Schenker dispatched at least one letter to
          Hindenburg, we cannot be sure how many and when, and on the basis of which draft(s). The
          only reply from Hindenburg is dated November 19, 1921, with the single remark: "Cordial
          thanks for kind "Misc." thoughts. Von Hindenburg." At that date, he can have seen only
          Heft 1. Schenker's reaction was: "From Hindenburg (letter): thanks; only the signature in
          his own hand." (OJ 3/3, p. 2403, November 26, 1921).</p>
