      <head>Bösendorfer, Ludwig</head>

      <div>
        <p>Austrian piano manufacturer. </p>

        <p>Ludwig Bösendorfer trained at the Vienna Polytechnic Institute, then worked at his father
          Ignaz's piano manufacturing firm (<ref cRef="bosendorfer">Bösendorfer</ref>), taking over the company in 1859
          and directing it until selling it to Carl Hutterstrasser in 1909. It was Ludwig who
          brought the company's pianos to the peak of their international fame, patenting an
          improved action, and retaining the artisan system of manufacture, resisting
          mass-production methods. </p>

        <p>Ludwig was a familiar, distinctive, top-hatted figure in Viennese society, and a patron
          of the city's musical life. He was made an honorary member of the <ref cRef="gesellschaft_der_mus">Gesellschaft der
          Musikfreunde</ref> in 1870, and a member of its governing body from 1878. He was a member of the
          committee of the Wiener Tonkünstler Verein at its inception in 1879, and later an honorary
          member. The Bösendorfer Piano Competition, which he initiated in 1889, continued annually
          until 1944, and since 1949 takes place every other year. </p>

        <head>Bösendorfer and Schenker</head>

        <p>During the academic year 1888/89, Ludwig Bösendorfer paid half of Schenker's fees at the
          Vienna Conservatory. At about the same time, on the recommendation of Schenker's teacher
          <ref cRef="ludwig_ernst">Ernst Ludwig</ref>, he made a Bösendorfer piano available to him for his studies; the earliest
          known letter in Schenker's hand dates from 1889/90, is addressed to Ludwig Bösendorfer,
          and asks for its replacement by a superior instrument (GdM Briefe, [1]; Federhofer, 6).
          (By the 1910s and 1920s, Schenker had a Blüthner grand in his music room.)</p>

        <p>In his diary for March 10, 1914, Schenker offers an amusing portrayal of Ludwig (OJ 1/14,
          p. 336=536): </p>
        <cit>
          <q>On the way back [from the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde Archive], encountered Mr.
            Bösendorfer. The conversation with him gave rise to quite curious, amusing moments. So,
            for example, the elderly gentleman, merely because two days earlier he had read my name
            in <title level="j">Die Zeit</title> in connection with Beethoven, wanted to impress upon me that he had mastered
            the entire secondary literature and possessed the most important books in his library
            "even if he doesn't read them." And in order to reinforce in me his familiarity with the
            secondary literature, this characteristically Viennese upright gentleman gave his
            opinion: Was it not true that the last things written about Beethoven were those by
            Ambros and Helm? Now that's what I call a point of view, and knowledge of Beethoven! --
            Nevertheless, I seized the favorable opportunity that presented itself to recount to him
            the affair of Lafite and Marchet [with whom Schenker had had a recent disagreement],
            whereupon with genuine Viennese falsehood he opined: "Marchet surely knows nothing of
            all this; the blame lies with Lafite and Habida.</q>
