      <head>Heinrich Rose</head>
      <div>

        <p>Specialist photographer; the approved photographer of <ref cRef="entity-004558"
            >Beethoven's birthplace</ref> in Bonn during the first two decades of the 20th
          century.</p>
        <div>
          <head>Career Summary</head>
          <p>Heinrich Rose was the son of a shoemaker, the family home being on the
            Heisterbacherhofstraße in Bonn. Nothing is known of his childhood or education. By 1906
            at the latest he had established a photographic studio at Kaiserplatz 8. He described
            himself as a "specialist photographer for industrial and artistic businesses, for
            preservation of monuments, museums, and architecture" (Bonn street directories). </p>

          <p>Rose was the officially approved photographer of the <ref cRef="entity-004558"
              >Beethoven-Haus</ref> at Bonngasse 20. In 1913, a letter to Schenker from <ref
              cRef="entity-000791">Ferdinand August Schmidt</ref> of that instution stated that he
            "works for the Beethoven-Haus on photographs of manuscripts, pictures, printed matter
            and the like [...] has already taken [...] photographs in the Beethoven-Haus for a range
            of publications" (OC B/204). He worked also for other collections in the Rhineland.</p>

        <div>
          <head>Rose and Schenker</head>
          <p>At Schenker's request, Rose made photographs (white-on-black) of Beethoven's piano
            sonatas <title>Op. 27, No. 2</title>, <title>Op. 28</title>, and <title>Op. 111</title>
            (the last of these as preparatory work for the <ref cRef="entity-001736"><title
                level="m">Erläuterungsausgabe</title> for Op. 111</ref>). Schenker wrote direct to
            Rose on December 9, 1913 (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="BNba-318_1">BNba 318,
              [1]</ref>). and received a communication from him on January 16, a package on January
            26, and the photographs of the three Beethoven sonatas on February 4, 1914 (Schenker's
            diary for those dates). Rose's photographs of <title>Op. 27, No. 2</title> are preserved
            as OC/B 310‒339, those of <title>Op. 111</title> as OC/B 340‒379.</p>
