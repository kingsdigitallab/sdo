        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Weingartner's career as a conductor began in 1884, and he held a series of appointments,
          successively at Königsberg, Danzig, Hamburg, Mannheim, and Berlin (1891-1907), and
          then succeeded Gustav Mahler after the latter had been forced out as director of the
          Vienna Hofoper in 1908, himself resigning in 1911 in the face of opposition from critics
          and the public, but retaining control of the Vienna Philharmonic concerts until 1927.
          Thereafter he held posts in other cities until being appointed director of the Vienna
          Volksoper (1919-24). He again directed the Vienna Hofoper (Staatsoper) 1935-36. Despite
          his early association with Liszt, he has been considered principally a conductor of
          Classical composers, notably Beethoven.</p>
        <p>As a composer he wrote seven operas, six symphonies, two symphonic poems, and much
          chamber music. As an author he wrote books on interpretation of the repertory (Mozart,
          Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann), on conducting, and memoirs.</p>

        <p>Weingartner's <title level="m">Ratschläge für Ausführungen der Symphonien
            Beethovens</title> (Leipzig: Breitkopf &amp; Härtel, 1906) is cited in the
          "Literatur" (Secondary Literature) sections of Schenker's <title level="m">Beethoven's
            Neunte Sinfonie</title>: Eng. trans., pp. 20 ("serious substantive efforts ... acquits
          himself to good advantage"), 51-3, 88, 104 ("makes the effort, which cannot be valued
          highly enough, to supplement the dynamic shadings on the basis of the sense of the
          composition"), 119-20, 135-36, 159-60, 176, 182 ("gives accurate guidance ... several
          corrections ... they are to be considered perfectly appropriate"), 222, 285 ("astute
          suggestions concerning stage arrangement ... good instinct"), 307-08 ("arrives at the only
          correct solution"), 316-19 ("rightly objects--it is just a pity that no reason is
          given!"), 330. Later, Schenker included the <title level="m">Ratschläge</title> in
          his discussion of the Fifth Symphony in <title level="j">Der Tonwille</title>, Heft 5
          (1923), and elsewhere in Heft 3 (1922) criticizing him for conducting an all-French
          program (Eng. trans., vol.1, pp. 136, 198-201, 221).</p>
        <p>Early in his career, as a music critic, Schenker had written <title level="a">Bülow-Weingartner</title> in 1895 (Federhofer (1990), pp.171-75), a review of an
          article by Weingartner entitled <title level="a">Ueber das Dirigiren</title> (1895),
          itself a reflection on an article by Wagner of the same title.</p>
        <p>There is no correspondence between Weingartner and Schenker, but several articles and
          concert programs survive in OC and OJ. For comments in Schenker's diary, see Federhofer
          (1985), pp. 267-68.</p>
