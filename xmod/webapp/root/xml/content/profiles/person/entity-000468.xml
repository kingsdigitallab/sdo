      <head>Felix Kornfeld</head>
      <div>
        <p>Son of <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette Schenker</ref> (<hi rend="italic">née</hi>
          Schiff; prev. Jenny Kornfeld); businessman.</p>

        <p>Felix was the younger son of <ref cRef="entity-000466">Emil Kornfeld</ref> and his wife
            <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jenny</ref> (later to be Jeanette Schenker), his elder brother
          being <ref cRef="entity-000467">Erich</ref>. Felix was born and brought up in <ref
            cRef="entity-002248">Aussig (Ústí nad Labem)</ref>. Like his brother, after his
          schooling he worked in his father's company, Klaber &amp; Kornfeld, traders in petroleum,
          oil and grease. When <ref cRef="entity-000466">Emil</ref> died in 1937, <ref
            cRef="entity-000467">Erich</ref> and Felix continued the company until it ceased trading
          soon afterward. Felix suffered from a "lame foot" (<hi rend="italic">Fusslähmung</hi>),
          possibly from early in life. </p>

        <p>Felix married Elsa Wobornik (1906‒) on March 7, 1931, the couple had a son, <ref
            cRef="entity-000469">Tomáš Kornfeld</ref>, born August 7, 1932. Felix and his brother
            <ref cRef="entity-000467">Erich</ref> ‒ neither of them observant Jews ‒ were arrested
          by the Gestapo on November 10, 1938 and taken to a concentration camp. Whereas <ref
            cRef="entity-000467">Erich</ref> was released six weeks later, Felix remained until May
          31, 1939, on which date he was released conditional upon emigration. At about this time,
          "out of fear, and compelled by those around her," Elsa (who was not Jewish) divorced him.
          Felix wrote to his mother on August 23, 1939 (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-14-7_1"
            >OJ 14/7, [1]</ref>), conveying this information and reporting his general state of
          mind, and asking for her help in finding a way to emigrate. She replied to him on
          September 1 and October 12, 1939, the contents of both of which are unknown. He was later
          re-arrested by the Gestapo and taken to <ref cRef="entity-007490">Theresienstadt</ref>,
          where he met his <ref cRef="entity-000771">mother</ref> again for the first and only time
          since 1910, before he was transferred to Auschwitz, where he perished in September 1944
            (<ref cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette</ref> remained in <ref cRef="entity-007490"
            >Theresienstadt</ref>, dying in January 1945).</p>

        <head>Felix Kornfeld and Heinrich Schenker</head>
        <p>Heinrich Schenker had been a close friend of <ref cRef="entity-000466">Emil
            Kornfeld</ref> since the early 1890s, apparently visiting the Kornfeld family in <ref
            cRef="entity-002248">Aussig</ref>, where he got to know <ref cRef="entity-000467"
            >Erich</ref> and Felix, as well as holidaying in the Alps with <ref cRef="entity-000466"
            >Emil</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jenny</ref> up to 1910, in which year <ref
            cRef="entity-000771">Jenny</ref> left <ref cRef="entity-000466">Emil</ref> and her sons
          to be permanently with Heinrich in Vienna. Thereafter, all contact between <ref
            cRef="entity-000771">Jenny</ref> and the family was broken off by <ref
            cRef="entity-000466">Emil</ref>, and her name was "taboo" to the two sons (<ref
            type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-71-21a_2">OJ 71/21a, [2]</ref>). Schenker's diary records
          that Jeanette heard from her sister <ref cRef="entity-003244">Klara Hatschek</ref> (<hi
            rend="italic">née</hi> Schiff) on May 9, 1932: "(long letter): all sorts of things –
          [...] concerning the Weils, Erich, and Felix," but no details are given there.</p>

        <p>One letter from Felix to Jeanette survives as <ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-14-7_1"
            >OJ 14/7, [1]</ref> (1939). Summer vacation postcards to Felix from Schenker alone, or
          jointly with <ref cRef="entity-000466">Emil</ref>, or <ref cRef="entity-000771"
            >Jenny</ref>, or <ref cRef="entity-000467">Erich</ref>, from the Tyrol in the period
          1903-10, existed in 1988 in the possession of his son, <ref cRef="entity-000469">Tomáš
            Kornfeld</ref>; letters also existed at that time from <ref cRef="entity-000771"
            >Jenny</ref> to Felix, written on Felix's birthday in 1912 and 1917, at least the first
          of which went unanswered, and further letters in 1940-41 (<ref type="correspondence"
            cRef="OJ-71-21a_2">OJ 71/21a, [2]</ref>).</p>
