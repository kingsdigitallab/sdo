        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Like Schenker (who was also born in Galicia), he was educated in Lemburg (L'vov, L'viv),
          and like him studied piano with Chopin's pupil and assistant Karol Mikuli (from 1872). He
          moved to Vienna with his family in 1875, continuing his piano studies with Rafael Joseffy.
          He took private lessons with Liszt in Weimar and Rome for nine years. At this time, he
          retired from music to study philosophy and aesthetics at Vienna University 1878-84, taking
          courses with, among others, Eduard Hanslick and <ref cRef="adler_guido">Guido Adler</ref>.
          He emigrated to the USA in 1938, living in New York.</p>

        <head>Rosenthal and Schenker</head>
        <p>Schenker and Rosenthal knew one another from at least 1894, when their correspondence
          begins, and when Rosenthal already addressed Schenker as "Dear Sir and Friend"; they quite
          possibly knew each other from Lemberg days. On November 10, 1912, Rosenthal wrote to
          Schenker to say that he had heard nothing more of Schenker's planned <ref
            cRef="organization_artists">"Organization for Creative and Performing Artists"</ref> (OJ
          13/29, [9], quoted Federhofer).</p>

        <head>Correspondence with Schenker</head>
        <p>Correspondence from Rosenthal to Schenker is preserved as OJ 13/29 (1894-1912: 12 items),
          and one draft letter from Moriz Violin to Rosenthal survives as OJ 70/3 (undated).</p>
