        <p>Virtuoso violinist and teacher; first violinist of the Buxbaum Quartet. </p>

          <head>Career Summary</head>
          <p> Pollak studied in Vienna (Johann Ritter) and Leipzig (Hans Sitt), then taught at the
            Geneva Conservatory (1905–14), a masterclass in Lausanne (1912), and at the Moscow
            Conservatory (1918–19), before returning to Vienna to teach the masterclass at the <ref
              cRef="neues_wiener_konserv">Neues Wiener Konservatorium</ref> (1919–26). At that time,
            he was the first violinst of the Buxbaum Quartet. Thereafter he taught in San Francisco
            (1926–30), in Tokyo (1930–36), and in Los Angeles from 1937 onward, becoming an American
            citizen in 1943. Among his pupils were Isaac Stern and Bronislaw Gimpel.</p>

          <head>Schenker and Pollak</head>
          <p>Schenker spoke once, in 1924 (DLA 69.930/13), of a Rudolf Pollak who fits the above
            description, recommending <ref cRef="halm_august">August Halm</ref> to send his A-major
            String Quartet to Pollak, in the hope of its being played through by the Buxbaum
            Quartet. He remarks that he and Pollak "maintain good relations." Pollak is mentioned in
            Schenker's diaries many times between 1922 and 1924, when he was in Vienna,
            referred to always just as "Pollak" or "Prof. Pollak."  Schenker himself played with
            Pollak and Buxbaum at a private charity concert (Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven trios) on
            December 23, 1923, attended in part by Furtwängler. </p>
          <p>There was certainly correspondence between Robert Pollak and Schenker, but none is
            known to survive. </p>
