      <head>Camillo Castiglioni</head>
      <div>

        <p>Italian-Austrian financier, banker and philanthropist, one of the wealthiest men in
          Europe in the early 20th century. </p>

        <p>Castiglioni worked first in his father's Gummiwarenfabrik AG [rubberware factory] in
          Vienna. He developed a passion for flying and ballooning, helped found Vienna's first aero
          club c. 1901, founded Motoren-Luftfahrzeuggesellschaft GmbH [motor air-vehicle company] in
          1907, and went on in 1914 to be the first financier to invest in the production of
          aircraft. After World War I he was highly influential in the development of the German car
          industry, notably Austro-Daimler and BMW. In the early 1920s he was President of the
          Austrian Depositenbank â€’ which, however, went bankrupt in 1924, after which he set up a
          private bank in Milan and amassed a further fortune. </p>

        <p>A notable art collector himself, his philanthropy toward the arts included support for
          the theater producer Max Reinhard and the building of a theater for him, and also helping
          him to organize the Salzburg Festival around 1920. </p>
