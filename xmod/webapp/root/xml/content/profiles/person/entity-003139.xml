      <head>Camillo Castiglioni</head>
      <div>

        <p>Italian-Austrian financier, banker and philanthropist, one of the wealthiest men in
          Europe in the early 20th century. </p>

        <p>Castiglioni worked first in his father's Gummiwarenfabrik AG [rubberware factory] in
          Vienna. He developed a passion for flying and ballooning, helped found Vienna's first aero
          club c. 1901, founded Motoren-Luftfahrzeuggesellschaft GmbH [motor air-vehicle company] in
          1907, and went on in 1914 to be the first financier to invest in the production of
          aircraft. After World War I he was highly influential in the development of the German car
          industry, notably Austro-Daimler and BMW. In the early 1920s he was President of the
          Austrian Depositenbank â€’ which, however, went bankrupt in 1924, after which he set up a
          private bank in Milan and amassed a further fortune. </p>

        <p>A notable art collector himself, his philanthropy toward the arts included support for
          the theater producer Max Reinhard and the building of a theater for him, and also helping
          him to organize the Salzburg Festival around 1920. </p>

        <head>Castiglioni and the Schenker circle</head>
        <p>According to Schenker's diary of October 17, 1923, his banker brother <rs
            key="entity-000774" type="person">Moriz</rs> suggested Castiglioni, though in what
          connection is unclear. On November 23, 1923, Walter Dahms was considering approaching
          Castiglioni for support in publishing his planned book on <hi rend="italic">bel canto</hi>
          (OJ 10/1, [81]). However, Schenker had already spoken to his brother in that regard on
          November 6, and recorded in his diary: <cit>
            <q>[He] agrees to speak to Camillo Castiglioni; it is possible that he is failing right
              at this moment because there was some small friction between Rome and Berlin, but Mr
              Camillo Castiglioni is striving for the title of Count; if that should be the case, he
              will give us access to the Prince of Liechtenstein. (OJ 3/5, p. 2595) </q>
          </cit>
        </p>

        <p>On November 20, Schenker pressed him further: "I request determined effort in the
          Castiglioni matter, since we would both otherwise find ourselves in an awkward situation"
          (p. 2599). On December 11, Schenker recorded that his brother had "haunted the
          antechambers of Castiglioni for one-and-a-half hours!" (p. 2605). Further reference occurs
          on February 6, 1924: "To Dahms (letter): relate the fate of the planned trio evening at
          Castiglioni's and about [Moriz]'s behavior; [he] has the best relationship with
          Castiglioni imaginable [...]" (p. 2631). </p>
