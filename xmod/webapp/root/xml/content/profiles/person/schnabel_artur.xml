        <head>Career Summary</head>
        
        <p>Having moved with his family to Vienna in 1889, he studied piano there with <ref
            cRef="leschetizky_theodor">Leschetizky</ref> and music theory with <ref
            cRef="mandyczewski_eusebiu">Mandyczewski</ref>. He moved to Berlin in 1900, and between
          1925 and 1933 taught at the Hochschule f&#xFC;r Musik in Berlin. He left Berlin only
          when Hitler came to power in 1933, moving first to Switzerland and in 1939 emigrating to
          the USA, eventually returning to Europe.</p>
        
        <p>He was celebrated especially as an interpreter of Beethoven and Schubert, and made many
          recordings; but also played contemporary music (he took part in one of the early
          performances of Schoenberg's <title level="m">Pierrot lunaire</title>), and composed in a
          modernist idiom. His publications include <title level="m">My Reflections on Music</title>
          (Manchester, 1933), <title level="m">Music and the Line of Most Resistance</title>
          (Princeton, 1942) and <title level="m">My Life and Music</title> (London, 1961).</p>

          <head>Schnabel and Schenker</head>
     
        <p>Schenker mostly recorded unfavorable or mixed comments about Schnabel's playing in his diary.
          For example, on January 28, 1909: "Concert by A. Schnabel: errors; loud, without shading;
          lack of principal accents and principal breathing-points"; on November 4, 1929: "[Diabelli
          Variations]: basically a pianist devoid of the elements of what composers and performers
          would consider art." Schenker also made adverse remarks on Schnabel's Beethoven editing
          (WSLB 211).</p>
             
        <p>One letter from Schabel to Schenker survives as OJ 14/14 (1925).</p>
