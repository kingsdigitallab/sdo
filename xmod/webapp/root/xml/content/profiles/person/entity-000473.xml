      <head>Trude Kral</head>
      <div>

        <p>Pupil of Hans Weisse and Heinrich Schenker. </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>In Vienna, Trude Kral was a piano pupil of Anka Bernstein Landau, the assistant of <ref
            cRef="entity-000718">Richard Robert</ref>. She emigrated to the United States, where she
          joined the piano faculty of the Third Street Music School in New York.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Kral and Schenker</head>
        <p>Trude Kral studied with <ref cRef="entity-000951">Hans Weisse</ref> from probably as early as 1924 (when under his
          encouragement she took out a subscription to Schenker's <title level="j">Der Tonwille</title>: OC 52/651). In 1925
          she was living on the Langegasse, in the 8th district of Vienna (Josefstadt). After
          Weisse's emigration to the United States in summer 1931, she became a pupil of Schenker
          himself. It is not surprising that there is no mention of her in the latter's lessonbooks,
          since they end at August 14, 1931. At the start of the 1931/32 season, she became a member
          of Schenker's "Friday seminar" with Greta Kraus, <ref cRef="entity-000754">Felix Salzer</ref>, and Manfred Willfort.
          She was not present at the first four meetings of the seminar (Oct 9–Nov 6), but is named
          in his informal notes as involved in the meeting on November 13 ("Kral III begins"),
          specifically in connection with the J. S. Bach C-major Prelude, <title level="m">Well-tempered Clavier</title>, Book
          I, which would later appear as the first item of the <title level="m">Fünf Urlinie-Tafeln</title> (1932). </p>

        <p>As to the 1932/33 season, a conversation between Kral and Schenker is recorded in the
          latter's diary at OJ 4/5, p. 3775, September 22, 1932, which Schenker reported to Salzer in a
          letter of the same date (FS 40/1, [13]), concerning seminar plans for the new season. Kral
          did not attend the opening meetings, and finally gave notice of withdrawal on November 7
          (OJ 4/6, p. 3789). </p>

      <div>
        <head>Correspondence</head>
        <p>Two pieces of correspondence between Kral and Schenker are known to survive, one letter
          from her to Schenker (OC 30/40, December 31, 1932), and one fragmentary draft of a letter from
          Schenker to Kral (OC 30/41, undated). </p>
