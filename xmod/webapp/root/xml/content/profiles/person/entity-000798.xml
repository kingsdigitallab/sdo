      <head>Arnold Schoenberg [Schönberg]</head>
      <div>
        <p>Austrian composer, earliest representative of Viennese musical modernism, creator of the
          twelve-tone method of composition, teacher of Alban Berg, Anton von Webern, and other
          composers in Vienna, Berlin, and, from 1934 on, in the USA.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Relations between Schoenberg and Schenker</head>
        <p>Contact between Schenker and Schoenberg was made first by the latter on September 12,
          1903, after he had been engaged by Busoni to orchestrate Schenker's <title level="m"
            >Syrische Tänze für Pianoforte zu 4 Händen</title> (Vienna: Weinberger, c.1899). The
          orchestration was not to Schenker's taste because it "suggests the style of Richard
          Strauss," but he evidently approved it, for the resulting performance took place on
          November 5, 1903. Schoenberg subsequently tried between November 10, 1903 and early 1904
          to enlist Schenker's participation in forming the Vereinigung schaffender Tonkünstler
          (Association of Creative Musicians). Communications between the two continued into 1907,
          when Schoenberg drew Schenker's attention to two concerts of his music (both of which
          Schenker attended and reported in his diary) and invited him to one of music by his
          pupils. The two evidently met several times, and were apparently on cordial terms until
          around 1910, when their relationship deteriorated.</p>
        <p>Although Schoenberg's musical style had its origins partly in Brahms and the Viennese
          Classical composers, Schenker became increasingly antagonistic toward him from around 1910
          because he saw him as advancing the stylistic innovations of Richard Strauss and Gustav
          Mahler, abandoning the Classical tonal tradition, and in the realm of theory espousing
          developing variation over repetition.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Breakdown of Cordialities</head>
        <p>The breakdown between the two men was perhaps impelled by <ref cRef="entity-000356">Emil
            Hertzka</ref>'s contracting Schoenberg for <ref cRef="entity-002408">Universal
            Edition</ref> in 1909 along with Mahler, Schreker, and Foerster; the issuing of UE's
          1910 catalogue announcing Schoenberg's Second String Quartet and <title level="m">Drei
            Klavierstücke</title>, Op. 11 may have been the catalyst for Schenker's antagonism.
          First private signs of this were Schenker's allusion to "a publisher that places its main
          emphasis these days on anti-musical music" in his letter to Hertzka of February 7, 1910,
          WSLB 52, which conveys Schenker's disillusionment with Hertzka's break from UE's original
          1901 commitment to an Austrian edition of the "classics." His resentment at what he saw as
          Hertzka's promotion of Schoenberg's <title level="m">Harmonielehre</title> over his own
          works emerges in WSLB 75, May 17, 1911, and three years later he suggests that UE should
          use its profits from Mahler's and Schoenberg's music to subsidize its publication of his
          own writings, OJ 5/16, [2], May 1914 (draft).</p>
        <p>The first step in the <hi rend="italic">public</hi> confrontation between the two,
          Schoenberg's response to Schenker's diatribes against Strauss and Reger in <title
            level="m">Harmonielehre</title> (1906) and the Foreword to <title level="m">Kontrapunkt
            1</title> (1910), was delivered in his own <title level="m">Harmonielehre</title> (1911
          and lengthened in the 1921 edition). Schenker first publicly named Schoenberg in his
            <title level="m">Erläuterungsausgabe</title> of Beethoven's Piano Sonata, Op.111 (1915),
          and his most sustained, personalised critique, of the chordal treatment of passing-tones
          in Schoenberg's <title level="m">Harmonielehre</title>, appeared in <title level="j">Das
            Meisterwerk in der Musik</title>, vol. II (1926), pp. 30-37 (Eng. trans., vol. II,
          12-16).</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Correspondence between Schoenberg and Schenker</head>
        <p>Correspondence between the two men comprises twelve personal letters from Schoenberg to
          Schenker, which survive only in photocopies in OJ 14/15 (see also OJ 60/2), plus one
          circular letter from Zemlinsky, Gutheil, and Schoenberg, and two invitations; none are
          known to have survived from Schenker to Schoenberg.</p>
