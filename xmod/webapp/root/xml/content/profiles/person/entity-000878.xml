      <head>Paula Szalit [Paulina Szalitówna]</head>

      <div>
        <p>Polish pianist and composer, pupil of Schenker's for a short period in 1896‒97.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Paula Szalit was born in Drohobycz, in <ref cRef="entity-002355">Galica</ref>, and
          studied at the <ref cRef="entity-002401">Lemberg</ref> Conservatory, next in Vienna with
          Robert Fischof and Josef Hofmann, then after a short period with Heinrich Schenker, with
            <ref cRef="entity-000150">Eugen d'Albert</ref>, and <ref cRef="entity-000523">Theodor
            Leschetizky</ref>. By one report, her older brother Heinrich, who had to relinquish his
          profession as a pianist because of eye trouble, taught her as a child, then brought her to
          Vienna to study with Fischof when she was eight years old (<title level="j">Blatt der
            Hausfrau</title>, vol. 22 (1902).</p>

        <p>She was celebrated as a child prodigy. <ref cRef="entity000331">Eduard Hanslick</ref>
          wrote c.1896: <cit>
            <q>A fellow countrywoman and worthy colleague of the young <ref cRef="entity-000393"
                >Hubermann</ref>, Paula Szalit belongs among the rarest of musical phenomena. I
              heard her perform a gavotte by Bach and several modern piano pieces not merely with
              complete security and freedom but also with a rhythmic feeling and a musical
              sensibility that are found in such a young person most extremely seldom.</q>
          </cit></p>

        <p>Indicative of her European reception in 1896 and 1897 is: <cit>
            <q>Our season, already underway, has now acquainted us also with a wonder child, the
              ten-year-old pianist Paula Szalit. […] She has already made a big splash in several
              cities, such as Vienna and Berlin. Here in Leipzig, too, she has caused a sensation
              and established herself as a genuine phenomenon, through the astounding level of her
              achievements, both in the remarkable advancement for such a young person of her
              technical facility, and in the clarity and secure accuracy of her development, then
              also through the sheer innate musicality of the little girl […] (<title level="j"
                >Signale für die musikalische Welt</title>, November 9, 1897).</q>
          </cit>
        </p>

        <p>Her career in playing not only solo recitals but also concertos with leading orchestras
          and piano chamber music with major ensembles continued through to 1906, in the September
          of which year she was appointed to the Lemberg Conservatory as the head of the advanced
          piano class – on hearing which Schenker commented in his diary: “‘Paula Szalit teacher in
          Lemberg’ ‒ that's the last we’ll see of the 'wonderchild'?!”. Thereafter, as the <title
            level="j">Wiener Hausfrauen-Zeitung</title> for 1912 reported, “to the great regret of
          the many admirers of her superb artistry, [she] has in recent times disappeared from the
          public eye.”</p>

        <p>She perhaps based herself in Lemberg, but her whereabouts during World War I, when
          Galicia was heavily fought over, are unknown. She is found again in Vienna in 1918, where
          she advertised that she had again taken up giving piano lessons, citing her address as
          Porzellangasse 19 (<title level="j">Neues Wiener Tagblatt</title>, October 17). Her death
          date is usually given as 1919 or 1920; however, she was still advertising piano lessons in
          1921: “Piano instruction: the well-known pianist Paula Szalit offers first-class tuition,
          now also including lessons in piano accompaniment and repetiteur work. Rotenlöwgasse 7”
            (<title level="j">Neue freie Presse</title>, March 27).</p>

        <p>As a composer she wrote short character pieces for piano, in particular her four books of
            <title level="m">Morceaux pour piano</title>, Op. 2 and her <title level="m"
            >Clavierstücke</title>, Op. 3, which continued to be played will into the 1930s.</p>

        <head>Szalit and Schenker</head>
        <p>Schenker reviewed what was probably her public debut in Vienna on February 14, 1896 ‒ at
          which time Szalit was being taught by Robert Fischhof ‒ beginning his remarks with: <cit>
            <q>On February 14 a nine-year-old child, Paula Szalit, demonstrated her wondrous talent.
              The little girl performed so astoundingly that ‒ to put it directly‒ she surpassed the
              audience's expectations. The best of her qualities, which inhabit the wonderful depths
              of her instinct, did not permeate into the public's awareness, and this reiterated (at
              this, the little girl's first public foray) the well-known fact that the contact of
              the audience with a significant talent ceases at precisely the point at which that
              talent reveals its best and most subtle features. The most conspicuous qualities of
              her playing gave them pleasure: its splendid rhythm and its elegantly developed finger
              dexterity; but the way in which her refined feeling for mood, melody and harmony took
              effect passed them by. They overlooked her utterly subtle pedal technique, which she
              has in common, quite simply, with the most mature of mature virtuosos. This pedal
              technique is for her not a jolly pumping of the foot, but enables her, in a way that
              for most pianists is still a highly secret art, to realize her feeling for melody and
              harmony. [...]</q>
          </cit></p>

        <p>He went on to compare her improvisation favorably with that of the 14-year-old prodigy
          violinist <ref cRef="entity-000393">Bronislav Hubermann</ref>.</p>

        <p>On April 5 of that year, <ref cRef="entity-000150">Eugen d'Albert</ref>, who was
          expecting to teach her in the near future, wrote to Schenker (OJ 9/6, [12]), saying: <cit>
            <q>I wholeheartedly concur with the idea that she should study with you for the time
              being, for you are a serious musician and will point the young lady in the right
              direction. [...] I should very much like to know as soon as possible whether the young
              lady is definitely coming to me, and if so when. [...] So would you take over the
              continuation of the young lady's study on my behalf in the intervening period?</q>
          </cit></p>

        <p>Schenker's 1897 diary (undated) records: "Paula Szalit prepared for concerts: among other
          things, J. S. Bach's Fugues in C-sharp minor (for 5 voices) and E-flat minor." A review
          (in which these works are not mentioned, so probably of a different concert) from November
          28, 1897 begins: <cit>
            <q>Paula Szalit, still very young, possesses a freely headlong-rushing, crackling
              technique that exhibits great temperament and a touch of genius. Dr. Heinrich Schenker
              introduced her to music with his unique thoroughness and instructional power, and her
              nature is now tamed in Leschetizky's appropriately named masterclass. (<title
                level="j">Wiener Abendpost</title>: OC 2/p. 20)</q>
          </cit></p>

        <p>In 1914, Szalit’s mother informed Schenker that her daughter had been “stricken with
          religious mania.” Commenting “Thus ends a life that had begun more brilliantly and
          promisingly than any other,” Schenker laid the blame on <ref cRef="entity-000523">Theodor
            Leschetizky</ref> (diary, June 18). In 1915, Szalit’s brother Heinrich informed him that
          she had been “tragically injured in an accident,” and that well-wishers were supporting
          her financially (diary, April 11).</p>

        <p>On November 13, 1918, Schenker recorded in his diary: "<ref cRef="entity-000655">Mrs.
            Pairamall</ref> passes on to me a letter from Miss Szalit [OJ 14/37, [3]], in which the
          latter requests a conversation with me, pressurized as she is by her very difficult
          predicament." The letter speaks of the lack of practice facilities to prepare for concert
          performance, and the difficulty in obtaining pupils. Schenker’s unsympathetic response
          was: "To Miss Szalit (letter): I recommend patience: indefatigability when giving lessons
          is a tried and proven recipe."</p>

        <head>Correspondence</head>
        <p>One letter of 1918 from Szalit to Schenker survives, with two undated earlier calling
          cards (OJ 14/37, [1]‒[3]). A full-length portrait of her by the photographer "Zaklad
          Michala Friedmana, Nowy Sacz" and inscribed "Paul Szalit, 15.7.95" survives in Schenker's
          papers as OJ 72/22, No. 1.</p>
