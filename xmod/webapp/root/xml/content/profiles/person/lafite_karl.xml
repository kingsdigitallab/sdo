        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Lafite studied organ, piano (Door), and composition (Fuchs) at the Vienna Conservatory
          1889-93; 1894-96 he taught in Olmütz [Olomouc], worked as an accompanist 1896-98 and in
          later years, was appointed organist of the Piaristenkirche in Vienna 1898, remaining in
          that post until 1910. He was thereafter a teacher at the Vienna blind institute and
          conductor of three Viennese institutions: the Sängerbund, the Singakadamie (where Schenker
          put on concerts), and the Damensingvereinigung (women's choral association).</p>

        <p>From 1908 to 1918 he worked as the music critic for the Vienna <title level="j">Allgemeine
          Zeitung</title>, later for the <ref cRef="neue_freie_presse">
            <title level="j">Neue Freie Presse</title>
          </ref> and the <ref cRef="neues_wiener_tagblat">
            <title level="j">Neues Wiener Tagblatt</title>
          </ref>. In 1910, he was one of the founders of the <ref cRef="neues_wiener_konserv">Neues
            Wiener Konservatorium</ref>, and from 1912 to 1922 served as the General Secretary of
          the <ref cRef="gesellschaft_der_mus">Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde</ref> and thereafter as

        <head>Lafite and Schenker</head>
        <p>Schenker had dealings with Lafite in the early 1900s regarding performance of
          compositions of his by the Singakademie and Damenchorverein. Schenker came into
          acrimonious conflict with him over an invitation to give a lecture or group of lectures to
          the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in 1912. In 1920, Weisse found Lafite an obstacle to
          giving lectures on Schenker's theory at the Urania.</p>
