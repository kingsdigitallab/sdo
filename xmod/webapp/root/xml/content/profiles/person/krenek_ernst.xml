      <head>Ernst Krenek [K&#x159;enek]</head>
      <div>
        <p>Austrian (later American) composer, and writer on music.</p>
      </div>

        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Krenek, of a Bohemian catholic family, studied counterpoint and composition with <ref
            cRef="schreker_franz">Franz Schreker</ref> in Vienna (1916-20) and Berlin (1920-), where
          he developed his own contrapuntal-atonal style with which he soon became an "enfant
          terrible" of modern music. Following the scandal-tainted performance of his Second
          Symphony in 1923, he lived in Switzerland until 1925, subsequently holding positions in
          the opera houses of Kassel and Wiesbaden, and returning to Vienna in 1928.</p>
        <p>His First String Quartet (1921) gained him a contract with Universal Edition, this
          resulting in the publication of his <title level="m">Symphonische Musik</title> (comp and
          pubd 1922), his scenic cantata <title level="m">Die Zwingburg</title> (1922, pubd 1923),
          operas <title level="m">Orpheus und Erydike</title> and <title level="m">Der Sprung
            &#xFC;ber Schatten</title> (1923, pubd 1924), and other works, culminating in his jazz
          opera <title level="m">Jonny spielt auf</title> (1925, first performed 1927), the work
          that brought him world-wide fame and independence while marking a return to tonality. In
          the early 1930s, he turned to twelve-tone composition, producing an opera using that
          technique, <title level="m">Karl V</title>, in 1933.</p>
        
        <p>From 1933, Krenek's writings and compositions were banned in Germany by the Nazis. At the
          annexation of Austria in 1938 he emigrated to the USA, by which time he had composed
          eleven operatic works, several ballets, three symphonies and some dozen other orchestral
          works, numerous chamber works including five string quartets, and much vocal music. In the
          USA, he taught at several universities over the next fifty years, from 1947 living in Los
          Angeles, then Palm Springs, and continuing to be highly active as a composer to the late
          1980s, with forays into electronic music, integral serialism, and aleatory.</p>
        <p>His many writings include:</p>

          <p>As a journalist he wrote over 500 articles, for <ref

          Anbruch</title></ref>, <title level="j">Pult und Takstock</title> (1925-35, both UE house

        <head>Krenek and Schenker</head>
        <p>Schenker viewed Krenek (of whose teacher, Schreker, he disapproved) as one among many
          practitioners of the "modern music" that he so lamented, especially when they were
          promoted by UE. His letters and diaries contain caustic remarks about <title level="m"
            >Jonny spielt auf</title> (he deplored jazz as much as atonal music) at the time of its
          first Vienna performance on December 31, 1927. As a regular reader of the <title level="j"
            >Frankfurter Zeitung</title>, he must have encountered Krenek's articles in that
        paper.</p>
