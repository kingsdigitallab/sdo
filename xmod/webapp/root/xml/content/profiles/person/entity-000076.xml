      <head>Julius Bittner</head>
      <p>Austrian composer and writer on music.</p>

        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Bittner studied law, receiving the doctorate and working as a judge and an attorney with
          the Justice Ministry for a time, and also music composition with Josef Labor with
          encouragement from Franz Schalk and Bruno Walter. He was closely associated with the
          Wiener Akademischer Wagner-Verein (Vienna Academic Wagner Association). As a composer,
          influenced by Wagner and later by Mahler, he wrote nine operas, a ballet, two operettas,
          incidental music, two symphonies, two symphonic poems, two string quartets, sacred choral
          works, and solo songs. </p>
        <p>Bittner was briefly music editor for <ref cRef="merker_der">
            <title level="j">Der Merker</title>
          </ref> (in 1919 Eberhard von Waechter states that Bittner and <ref cRef="entity-000864">Richard Stöhr</ref> were joint editors of that journal: OJ 15/5, [6]), and also
          President of the Wiener Tonkünstlerverein. He contributed articles to <title level="j">Der
            Merker</title> (1910, 1918, 1920) and <title level="j">Musikblätter des Anbruch</title>
          (1924). </p>

        <head>Bittner and Schenker</head>
        <p>There seems to have been no direct contact between Bittner and Schenker, nor is there any
          known correspondence. They were both among some seventy signatories to a letter to Gustav
          Mahler in May 1907 expressing support for him in his conflit with the Vienna Court Opera.
