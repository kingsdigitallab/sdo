        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Born in Bohemia, Mahler came to Vienna to study at the Conservatory, 1875-78, with Julius
          Epstein (piano), Robert Fuchs (composition), and Franz Krenn (theory). After a series of
          appointments in other cities, he served as Music Director (Kapellmeister) of the Vienna
          Hofoper for ten turbulent years, 1897-1907, where he raised the standard of the opera
          house to among the finest in Europe, and established himself particularly as a conductor
          of Mozart and Wagner, later also of Richard Strauss, Puccini, Pfitzner and others,
          numbering among his assistant conductors Bruno Walter and Franz Schalk. After his enforced
          resignation, partly out of anti-semitism, in 1907 he was succeeded by Felix Weingartner.
          He was also Director of the Vienna Philharmonic Concerts 1898-1901. From 1907, he worked
          in New York at the Metropolitan Opera House and also as conductor of the New York
          Philharmonic, returning to Vienna for the last few months of his life.</p>

        <head>Mahler and Schenker</head>
        <p>Federhofer comments: "We do not know what kind of relationship [Schenker] had with Mahler
          ..., for Schenker expressed his views only briefly and very rarely regarding his works and
          achievements as a conductor. He valued him as a conductor, but he rejected his works"
            (<title level="m">Nach Tageb&#xFC;chern</title>, p.62). Schenker described a performance
          of Smetana's <title level="m">Dalibor</title> in 1897 as "excellent, and under G. Mahler's
          direction, to whom we take this opportunity to pay tribute also for his truthful
          performances of the <title level="m">Nibelungen</title> tetralogy, the <title level="m"
            >Marriage of Figaro</title>, <title level="m">Don Giovanni</title>, <title>Czar und
            Zimmermann</title>, etc." (Federhofer, <title level="m">Essayist</title>, p.358).</p>
        <p>Schenker's diary comments include the following:
          
          <cit><q>[1898]: G. Mahler. (Symphony) Annoyingly immature, and
          good-for-nothing, its irreverent pretentiousness all the more ridiculous ..." (OJ 1/4,
          p.6) [January 3, 1907]: "open rehearsal of Mahler's Sixth Symphony: a work completely
          devoid of culture, childishly grotesque. A glittering barn-full of percussion instruments,
          and in the Finale the composer as a musical clown. (OJ 1/5, p.32)</q></cit></p>
          
        <p>At the height of opposition against Mahler, in the press and in other quarters, Schenker
        lent him his support, as noted in his diary:
        
          <cit><q>[May 22, 1907]: Open letter to Mahler signed on a deliberate whim;
          situation not without humor. (OJ 1/4, p.41)</q></cit></p>
        
        <p>Four days later there was a stir in the press over this, and Schenker, in a heavily
        reworked entry of which this is the final version, wrote:
        
          <cit><q>[May 26, 1907]: "ttack by Dr. Robert Hirschfeld in the Feuilleton of
          the <title level="j">Extrablatt</title> over the signing of the Mahler open letter: in
          this he shows himself quite simply incapable of understanding that, even though I may have
          serious criticisms to level against Mahler in the most forceful manner, that does not mean
          that I should at the same time make him suffer for the highest, highest conceivable
          standards to which I hold him, [standards] that could indeed still less be applied to the
          other musicians around him. It is, however, quite futile to try to instruct on such a
          subject someone who thinks that taste alone governs art, especially a virtually uneducated
          taste. People want to speak only of a "genius" (on account of their own vanity!) or to
          criticize the artist (as it were, out of desire for revenge, because "genius" has not
          manifested itself in him); but they cannot understand how one might seriously criticize
          someone's achievement without also thereby ... wanting directly to press for their
          personal removal, especially when, as was the case with Mahler, removal would be bound to
          cause greater disadvantage than gain. (OJ 1/6, p.42)</q></cit></p>
        
        <p>Mahler himself wrote thanking Schenker; this is the only item of correspondence that
          exists between the two men: OJ 12/48, undated note:
          
          <cit><q>Dear Doctor, My heartfelt thanks to you for your friendly good wishes.
          Yours most truly, Mahler.</q></cit></p>
          
        <p>Following Mahler's resignation, Schenker wrote the somewhat self-righteous entry
          (undated, probably October/December 1907), perhaps with Hirschfeld's attack in mind:
          
          <cit><q>Gustav Mahler: People acclaimed him, people rated him as a genius in
          all that he thought, undertook and completed. In the end, many, many years later, it
          dawned on them—over the course of time—what he really represented. Now all those who have
          extricated themselves from their error are angry with—of all people!—me, who from the very
          beginning had taught them to perceive how all-too-lowly the extent of artistic mastery in
          Mahler was. Isn't it a merry qui pro quo that they consider me to be contradictory instead
          of realizing that it is they themselves who are contradictory? It is just like the
          illusion that the fields are rushing past one, while in fact it is the train in which one
          sits that is doing the rushing past. The person who is moving believes the unmoving to be
          in motion." (OJ 1/4, p.27 = OJ 1/6, p.50)</q></cit></p>
          
        <p>Later in his career, Schenker continued to make adverse entries in his diary about Mahler
          as a composer.</p>

        <head>Mahler in Schenker's Writings</head>
        <p>Surprisingly, there is no reference to Mahler in the unpublished <title level="m"
            >Niedergang der Kompositionskunst</title> (Decline in the Art of Composition)
          (c.1905-09) —Schenker's first sustained public attack on Wagner and his legacy in
          Bruckner, Wolf, and Richard Strauss. In <title level="j">Der Tonwille</title>, Schenker
          refers to Mahler's "touchings-up" of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony (Heft 8-9, p. 54; Eng.
          trans., vol. II, p. 122), which had previously been the subject of a brief aside in his
          1901 article <title level="a">Beethoven-'Retouche'</title> (Federhofer, <title level="m"
            >Essayist</title>, p. 266).There is one reference to him in <title level="j">Das
            Meisterwerk in der Musik</title>, vol. III, p.18 (Eng. trans., p.6).</p>
