      <head>Emil Gaertner [Gärtner]</head>
      <div>
        <p>Engineer, senior official in the Austrian Railways, brother of the bass vocalist, <ref
            cRef="entity-000274">Eduard Gärtner</ref>, and uncle of <ref cRef="entity-000276">Hans
            Gärtner</ref>. His official title in 1906 was "Building High Commissioner in the
          Ministry of Railways" (<hi rend="italic">Bau-Oberkommissär im Eisenbahn-Minsterium</hi>),
          and by 1919 he was "Chief Building Counselor (<hi rend="italic">Oberbaurat</hi>) in the
          Ministry of Railways.</p>

        <head>Emil Gaertner and Schenker</head>
        <p>There are many appearances of the name "Gärtner" in Schenker's diaries between 1906 and
          1911. While most of them relate to musical matters, so are likely to refer to Eduard,
          there is a group of references in late 1906 and 1907 that seem to refer to Emil.
          Schenker's diary for October 8, 1906 records "Payment of Gärtner's debt demanded." The
          diary for November 6 records "100 florins returned to Gärtner," presumably reflecting
          part-repayment of the debt. The December 24, 1907 entry conclusively records "Emil Gärtner
          has the effrontery to insult me by not replying ‒ true, it concerned a small favor over
          money, so it was a matter on which fate has clearly made a point of constantly only
          shaming and humiliating me." "Gärtner" also appears, together with "<ref
            cRef="entity-003210">[Josef] Redlich</ref>," in relation to Schenker's withdrawal in
          November 1906 from the masonic lodge that he had recently joined, and Emil seems the more
          likely referent than Eduard.</p>

        <p>On July 2, 1918, in the printed announcement of his brother Eduard's funeral (<ref
            type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-11-17_3">OJ 11/17, [3]</ref>), Gaertner signed himself
          with the honorific title <hi rend="italic">Oberstaatsbahnrat</hi> (Chief State Railway
          Counselor). He figures in Schenker's diaries again from June 1919 after the awarding of
          the <ref cRef="entity-002334">South Tyrol</ref> to Italy under the Treaty of
          St Germain. The Schenkers approached him for help in obtaining visas to access their
          favorite vacation area, but after promises had been made the approach proved abortive (the
          Schenkers went to Styria, as they had done in 1918).</p>
