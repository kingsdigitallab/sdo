      <head>Julia [Julie] Schenker [<hi rend="italic">née</hi> Mosler]</head>
      <div>
        <p>Mother of Heinrich Schenker, wife of <ref cRef="entity-000772">Johann Schenker</ref>.</p>

        <p>Little is known of Julia (administrative documentation and her gravestone call her
          "Julie") Schenker's early life other than her birth in 1828. Julia’s father was a tailor,
          "but always devoted himself to Hebrew literature, in which he was very well-versed"; and
          in her "parental house there existed that spiritual-intellectual atmosphere that is
          peculiar to the Jews." Schenker's diary for December 23, 1917 contains a tribute to her by
          Heinrich on her burial day. This tells us that Julia had siblings: "two or three of my
          mother's brothers became [medical] doctors." It also states that "she did not have any
          education to speak of."</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Marriage</head>
        <p>Schenker records on January 3, 1918 ‒ some 60 years after the event referred to ‒ that a
          friend of the Schenker family, <ref cRef="entity-000569">Marcus Marienberg</ref>,
          "remembered quite precisely [my father's] first meeting with my mother in <ref
            cRef="entity-002333">Wisniowczyk</ref>," but gave no hint of the date.</p>

        <p>Of the marriage of Julia Mosler to <ref cRef="entity-000772">Johann</ref>, Schenker wrote
          to <ref cRef="entity-000913">Moriz Violin</ref> on December 29, 1927 (OJ 6/7, [36]): <cit>
            <q>My father had originally married according to the Jewish rite; only much later were
              such marriages recognized also by the state. Later, when rectification was made, it
              was possible to adjust the official records to suit oneself. I know this because my
              parents told me so.</q>
          </cit>
        </p>

        <p>Since the synagogue records do not survive, the date of their Jewish marriage cannot be
          ascertained; but it must have taken place before 1859, the year in which the couple's
          first child, <ref cRef="entity-003791">Marcus</ref>, was born. The official state
          recognition of their marriage did not occur until April 30, 1876 (JRI-Poland), on which
          date, when <ref cRef="entity-000772">Johann</ref> was 43 and Julia 42, a civil marriage
          ceremony may have taken place. (See the <ref type="external"
            target="http://agadd.home.net.pl/metrykalia/300/sygn.%20993/pages/PL_1_300_993_0010.htm"
            >official record</ref> ‒ right-hand page, sixth entry from the top.)</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Children</head>
        <p>According to a record in the registry of the Jewish Religious Community in Vienna dated
          January 23, 1895, <ref cRef="entity-000772">Johann</ref> and Julia had six children: <ref
            cRef="entity-003791">Marcus</ref> [1859‒79], Rebecka [d. 1889], <ref
            cRef="entity-000775">Wilhelm</ref> [1862‒19??], <ref cRef="entity-000319">Schifre
            [Sofie] [Guttmann]</ref> [c.1864‒19??], Heinrich [1868‒1935] (all born in <ref
            cRef="entity-002333">Wisniowczyk</ref>), and <ref cRef="entity-000774">Moriz</ref>
          [1874‒1936] (born in <ref cRef="entity-004091">Podhajce</ref>).</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Later Life</head>
        <p>After her husband's death in late 1887, Julia moved with her impoverished family to
          Vienna, to be near Heinrich. Of this he later recorded: <cit>
            <q>Already during my earliest years, because I had to support mother, sister [<ref
                cRef="entity-000319">Schifre</ref>, later Sophie Guttmann], younger brother (today
              the so ungrateful billionaire) [<ref cRef="entity-000774">Moriz</ref>], and niece
              [Frieda?] by giving piano lessons, I gladly accepted an offer from a Viennese friend
              of <ref cRef="entity-000333">[Maximilian] Harden</ref> to write something for him.
                (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="DLA-69.930-10">DLA 69.930/10</ref>, September 25,
              1922, to <ref cRef="entity-005449">August Halm</ref>)</q>
          </cit></p>

        <p>By contrast, in his diary for December 20, 1917, he remarked: <cit>
            <q>Yes, she was the one who in my first difficult Viennese time took on all the debts
              with the merchants and the tradesmen, saving me from measures which I could only have
              wrested from my pride with difficulty.</q>
          </cit>
        </p>

        <p>Little is known of her character, but a passing remark about <ref cRef="entity-000775"
            >Wilhelm</ref> made in 1927 offers a possible hint: "Wilhelm is also much too animated
          and also much too domineering (<hi rend="italic">herrschsüchtig</hi>) – something
          inherited from our dear mother – to be comforted by this" (diary September 3 1927).
          Heinrich took his responsibilities toward his mother seriously ("for [September] 19
          (Jewish holidays) : a few pennies for Mama, seats in the synagogue etc.": OJ 6/4, [],
          Schenker to <ref cRef="entity-000913">Violin</ref>, September 15/18, 1906), and taking
          care of her when she was ill. Julia Schenker provided a vital link to Heinrich's Jewish
          heritage, coming out with Jewish sayings, and reminding him of customs and holy days: <cit>
            <q>Evening with mother at <ref cRef="entity-000192">Uncle</ref> and <ref
                cRef="entity-000193">Aunt Einschenk</ref>'s, for Passover. Old memories!: The ritual
              meal unexpectedly remedies an upset stomach that has persisted for several days!
              (diary March 30, 1907 ‒ the first seder in 1907 took place on Friday March 29)</q>
          </cit></p>
        <p>During the period after <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette Kornfeld</ref> left her first
          husband to be with Heinrich (1910-), Julia accepted and befriended Jeanette when others in
          Heinrich's circle ostracized her.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Death</head>
        <p>Julia was housed with <ref cRef="entity-000775">Wilhelm Schenker</ref> and his wife <ref
            cRef="entity-000767">Dodi</ref> in <ref cRef="entity-002301">Kautzen</ref> (within a few
          miles of the Czech Republic) in the three years leading to her death on December 22, 1917,
          and Heinrich was much involved in the burial ritual (in <ref cRef="entity-002323"
            >Waidhofen an der Thaya</ref>, within ten miles of <ref cRef="entity-002301"
            >Kautzen</ref> to the south, which had a Jewish cemetery), the saying of Kaddish, and
          the erection of the gravestone (diary December 1917, January/February 1918, <hi
            rend="italic">passim</hi>). The inscription on her gravestone, Row 8, grave 5, reads: <cit>
            <q>Hier ruht / Frau / Julie Schenker / geb. Mosler / Arztensgattin aus Podhajce / gest.
              in Kautzen am 20. Dez. 1917 / im 90. Lebensjahre. // Unerschrocken und unbeirrt / ging
              sie durch das Leben / in Glauben und Liebe.<lb/><lb/>Here lies / Mrs. / Julie Schenker
              / née Mosler / doctor’s wife from Podhajce / who died in Kautzen on December 20, 1917
              / in the 90th year of her life. // Undaunted and undeterred, / she lived her life / in
              faith and love. (transcr. Lee Rothfarb and Martin Eybl, Oct 2, 2015)</q>
          </cit></p>

        <p>In 1918, Schenker tried to have the coffin transported from <ref cRef="entity-002323"
            >Waidhofen</ref> to Vienna, but the cost proved too high.</p>

        <p>Heinrich and Jeanette visited Julia's grave for the first time on September 13, 1923 (OJ
          5/45, [4]) and recorded the following description: <cit>
            <q>The gravestone is simple, but dignified; since the marble slab and the engraving
              break with orthodoxy, Lie-Liechen is right in wishing for a frame and ivy decoration.
              It made me uneasy to feel that my poor mother, who was the one to hold us together for
              so long after the death of my father, lies far from us children, as if unreachable!
              Fate played a bad enough role in the very last years, so it would have been fair if it
              had granted her a resting place where the purpose of her life could have continued as
              if symbolically. (OJ 3/4, p. 2567)</q>
