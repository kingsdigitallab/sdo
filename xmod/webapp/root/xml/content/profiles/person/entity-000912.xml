      <head>Karl [Karli; Carli] Violin [Bubi]</head>

      <div>
        <p>Son of <ref cRef="entity-000913">Moriz</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000914">Valerie

        <head>Life summary</head>
        <p>Prone to illness in childhood, Karl Violin became seriously ill in September 1922 and was
          bedridden for months (OJ 14/45, [16]). His illnesses and general well-being were a
          frequent topic of his father's letters to Schenker, and the latter often inquired after
          him. He died aged 20.</p>

      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Correspondence</head>
        <p>Letters from Karl Violin to Heinrich Schenker exist as OJ 14/46, [B] and [C], both
          undated and filed with the <ref cRef="entity-000909">Fanny Violin</ref> correspondence.
          Schenker's diary records receipt of letters from him, and responses. Schenker wrote a
          letter of condolence over his death to Moriz and Valerie, but it is undated (OJ 6/8,
          [21]). Approximate date of death is deduced from Schenker's receipt of a letter from
          Josefine Schenker (wife of Eduard Violin) on January 23 reporting Karl's death (Schenker's
          diary, January 23), and from a letter from Josefine Violin to Ludwig Karpath (OJ 18/45) on
          January 23: "At the request of my brother-in-law, Moriz Violin in Hamburg, I take the
          liberty of conveying to you the sad news that his son Karl has passed away <hi
            rend="italic">in the last week</hi>." (italics editorial).</p>
