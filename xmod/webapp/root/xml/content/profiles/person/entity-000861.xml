      <head>Käthe Stirling(-Wimmer)</head>

      <div>
        <p>Pupil of Schenker's who appears in his lessonbooks from January 19, 1912 to June 27,
          1913, taking two lessons per week, but whose time as a pupil probably dates back to
          1906.</p>

        <head>Stirling(-Wimmer) and Schenker</head>
        <p>It is unknown how far before 1912 she became a pupil, however Schenker records in his
          diary for November 5, 1906: "<ref cRef="entity-006228">Professor von Bocklet</ref>
          recommends a new pupil, Mrs. Stirling-Wimmer." (OJ 1/5, p. 26); it is noteworthy that
          Schenker records for November 9, 1911: "Mrs. Jenny Eissler and Käthe Stirling-Wimmer have
          subscribed 3,000 and 5,000 Kronen respectively for the building of the Konzertverein
          House...." (Jenny Eissler was one of Schenker's patrons at least during 1906 to 1909.)
          Schenker tells us (diary) that on June 10, 1913 she married for the third time.</p>

        <p>Whether the pupil of 1912–13 was the 1906 recommended person and 1911 Konzerthaus donor
          is not fully established, but evidence from a lessonbook entry of February 13, 1912
          ("Brahms Intermezzo in B-flat minor <hi rend="italic">taken up again</hi>") suggests that
          they were one and the same person. Also unclear is whether she was a descendent of Jane
          Wilhelmina Stirling (1804–59), Scottish pupil of Chopin's for several years in Paris, to
          whom Chopin later dedicated his two Nocturnes, Op. 55.</p>

        <p>No correspondence between Mrs. Stirling and Schenker is known to survive.</p>
