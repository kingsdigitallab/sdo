      <head>Simon Szalit [Schalit]</head>
      <div>

        <p>Accountant, probably in the oil industry centered around Drohobycz; father of pianist
            <ref cRef="entity-000878">Paula Szalit</ref>.</p>

        <p>Simon Szalit and his wife <ref cRef="entity-008069">Reisel</ref> had four children: Beile
          (1866–), <ref cRef="entity-007722">Heinrich</ref> (1867–), Rebeca (1871–), and <ref
            cRef="entity-000878">Paula</ref> (1885–1942). Of these, Heinrich and Paula are known
          both to have been musically gifted.</p>

        <p><ref cRef="entity-007722">Heinrich</ref> having been in charge of <ref
            cRef="entity-000878">Paula</ref>’s musical education for the first ten years of her
          life, Simon, in written correspondence with her third teacher, <ref cRef="entity-000150"
            >Eugen d’Albert</ref> in 1897, appears to have taken charge of Paula’s performance
          career, probably after she became an international celebrity in 1895. He insisted that she
          increase her number of public appearances when d’Albert was advising that she take a total
          rest from public performance over the winter of 1897/98.</p>

        <p><ref cRef="entity-000878">Paula</ref> herself wrote to Schenker in 1918 that she was
          entirely “cut off” from her family. This suggests that a rift had taken place somewhere
          between 1906, when she returned to <ref cRef="entity-002401">Lemberg</ref> as head of the
          advanced piano class at the Lember Conservatory, at which point her performing career
          appears to have stopped, and some time in the 1910s.</p>

        <head>Correspondence</head>
        <p>No correspondence between Simon Szalit and Heinrich Schenker is known ever to have
          existed. The correspondence between Szalit and Eugen d’Albert does not survive.</p>
