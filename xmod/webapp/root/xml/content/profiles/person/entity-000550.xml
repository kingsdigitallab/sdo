      <head>Victor Vaughn Lytle</head>
      <div>
        <p>Organist and music theorist who taught at Oberlin Conservatory, Ohio, arguably the first
          to promote Schenker's ideas in teaching and writing in the United States.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Career; Lytle and Schenker</head>
        <p>Lytle received his MusB and MusM from Oberlin in 1912 and 1926, and taught at Oberlin as
          an instructor from 1913, then continuously from 1921 until his retirement in 1949. He was
          on study leave in Vienna in 1928-30, studied for at least part of that time with <ref cRef="entity-000951">Hans Weisse</ref>, and wrote to Schenker in 1930. Even before this,
          he had allegedly wished to introduce Schenker's ideas into his Oberlin teaching, and he
          seems to have incorporated the ideas he had learned from Weisse into that teaching
          subsequent to 1930.</p>
        <p>Lytle published an article on the state of present-day music in 1931 in which he adopted
          both the polemical stance and the theoretical conceptual language of Schenker. His later
          counterpoint book (1940) quotes from Schenker's <title level="m">Kontrapunkt</title>.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Correspondence with Schenker</head>
        <p>Three letters from Lytle to Schenker (1930) survive as OJ 12/46; none are known to
          survive from Schenker to Lytle. In letters to several of his correspondents, Schenker
          mentioned Lytle as promulgating his ideas in the United States.</p>
