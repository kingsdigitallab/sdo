      <head>Luigi Cherubini</head>
      <div>

        <p>Italian composer and music theorist.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Cherubini composed some thirty operas and other stage works, also Masses, cantatas,
          motets, canticles, antiphons, and works for special and ceremonial occasions, many solo
          vocal works, duets, etc., much chamber music, and several pedagogical works.</p>

        <p>He was director of the Paris Conservatory from 1822 to 1842, and it was during this
          period that, in conjunction from Fromental Halévy, he wrote his highly successful <title
            level="m">Cours de contre-point et de fugue</title> (Paris: Maurice Schlesinger,
          [1835]), twice translated into English, twice into German, and once into Italian. This was
          the last of three rival treatises on the subject all produced at the same institution, the
          other two being by Antonín Reich (1824‒26) and François-Joseph Fétis (1824). </p>

        <head>Cherubini and Schenker</head>
        <p>Schenker owned a copy of the German translation of Cherubini's treatise by Gustav Jensen
          (Köln, 1896) (see <bibl><editor>Heinrich Hinterberger</editor>, <title level="m">Music und
              Theater enthaltend die Bibliothek des Herrn Dr. Heinrich Schenker, Wien</title>
            (1836), item 88)</bibl>. As his diary tells us, he read Cherubini's treatise in August
          1907 as part of his preparation for writing <ref cRef="entity-001725"><title level="m"
              >Kontrapunkt</title></ref> (1910, 1922), in which he cites and quotes extensively from
          Cherubini on numerous occasions throughout the two volumes (including the final <title
            level="a">Bridges to Free Composition</title>). On each principal topic, Schenker
          conducts a review of the historical literature, drawing on the treatises of Fux,
          Albrechtsberger, Cherubini, and Bellermann in that order. Cherubini's very inclusion in
          these literature reviews, and the exclusion of so many other theorists ‒ even though he
          often finds Cherubini's opinion "misguided" or "wrong-headed"! ‒ bears witness to his
          respect for the Italian's work.</p>
