        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Johann Nepomuk Fuchs, the elder brother (and first teacher) of <ref cRef="entity-000265"
            >Robert Fuchs</ref>, studied music theory in Vienna with <ref cRef="entity-006865">Simon
            Sechter</ref>, was appointed conductor of the Bratislava Opera in 1864, conducted at the
          Vienna Court Opera in 1880, then professor at the Vienna Conservatory in 1888, where he
          taught theory of harmony, counterpoint, and composition, until his death. In 1893 he was
          appointed Director of the Conservatory, which position he held also until his death.</p>

        <p>Fuchs composed one opera, incidental music for the theatre, Lieder, and piano works. He
          played an important role as an editor of music, notably as an editor of the Schubert
          Collected edition, published by Breitkopf &amp; Härtel, 1884–97, editing the dramatic
          works and some of the orchestral music.</p>

        <head>Johann Nepomuk Fuchs and Schenker</head>
        <p>In his third year of study at the Vienna Conservatory, Schenker enrolled in Fuchs’s
          composition course in October 1889, but his experience of Fuchs was short-lived because he
          withdrew altogether from the Conservatory on November 20. Schenker seems to have left no
          reflections on Fuchs’s teaching.</p>
