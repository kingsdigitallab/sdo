      <head>Alfred Einstein</head>
      <p>German musicologist (cousin of Albert Einstein).</p>
      <div>
        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Einstein's doctoral dissertation (Munich University, 1903; pubd Leipzig 1905) was on
          16th- and 17th-century music for the viola da gamba. In the years following, he wrote
          articles on quattrocento and renaissance vocal music. As founding editor of the <title
            level="j">Zeitschrift f&#xFC;r Musikwissenschaft</title> 1918-33, he occupied a
          European-wide position of great influence. He was also music critic of the <title
            level="j">M&#xFC;nchner Post</title> (-1927) and the <title level="j">Berliner
          Tagblatt</title> (1927-33), where again he exerted much influence. In 1933, he left
          Germany for England and Italy, moving to the USA in 1939, where he continued his scholarly
          work, teaching at Smith College and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>His major publications include <title level="m">Geschichte der Musik</title> (Leipzig:
          Teubner, 1917), later translated as the widely used <title level="m">A Short History of
            Music</title> (1948); his studies <title level="m">Heinrich Sch&#xFC;tz</title> (Kassel:
          B&#xE4;renreiter, 1928); <hi rend="italic">Gluck</hi> (London: Dent, 1936); <title
            level="m">Mozart: His Character, His Work</title> (London &amp; Toronto: Cassell, 1945);
            <title level="m">Schubert: A Musical Portrait</title> (New York &amp; London: Cassel,
          1951); <title level="m">Music in the Romantic Era</title>, <title level="s">Norton History
            of Music Series</title> (New York: W. W. Norton, 1947); and above all his highly
          influential <title level="m">The Italian Madrigal</title> (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1949).
          He also edited the 9th-11th editions of <title level="m">Riemanns Musik-Lexikon</title>
          (1919-29: a typewritten copy of the article on Schenker in the 11th edition is preserved
          in Schenker's scrapbook OC 2/p.79), and K&#xF6;chel's catalogue of Mozart's works (1937).
          He was also active as editor of a wide range of music from the 14th to 18th centuries,
          notably his edition <title level="m">W. A. Mozart: The Ten Celebrated String
          Quartets</title> (1945).</p>

          <hi rend="bold">Schenker and Einstein</hi>
        </p>
        <p>Schenker's contact with Einstein probably arose out of the latter's position at the Drei
          Masken Verlag at the time <title level="j">Das Meisterwerk in der Musik</title> was being
          published by that company (1925-30). In this capacity, Einstein wrote eleven of the
          day-to-day letters, including one that threatened Schenker with legal action over the
          costs of <title level="j">Meisterwerk</title> vol. II (December 11, 1926).</p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="bold">Correspondence</hi>
        </p>
        <p>Most of the correspondence between Schenker and Einstein survives in the Oster Collection
          as part of the Drei Masken Verlag correspondence, OC 54 (1924-27), but there are also OC
          B/139 (1930) and OC 50/15 (1931), and in the Oswald Jonas Collection OJ 10/17 (undated)
          and OJ 36/117 (1939) (all Einstein to Schenker). Two letters from Schenker to Einstein
          survive in BerkAE (1926, 1928).</p>
        <p>Einstein published Oswald Jonas's article <title level="a">Das Autograph von Beethovens
            Violinkonzert,</title> in the <title level="j">Zeitschrift f&#xFC;r
          Musikwissenschaf</title>t 13 (May 1931), 443-450, and also his review of <title level="j"
            >Meisterwerk</title> vol. III (November 1932: OC 2/p.88).</p>
