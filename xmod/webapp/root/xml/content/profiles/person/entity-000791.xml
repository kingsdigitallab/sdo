      <head>Ferdinand August Schmidt</head>
      <div>

        <p>German medical doctor, specialist in the physiology of sport, advocate for physical
          education in Germany and for the development of sport science; co-founder of the Verein
            <ref cRef="entity-004558">Beethoven-Haus</ref> in Bonn, later vice-chairman of its board
          of directors.</p>

        <div>
          <head>Career Summary</head>
          <p>Schmidt attended school in <ref cRef="entity-002603">Bonn</ref>, studied medicine at
            Bonn University 1872‒76, then after further studies in Berlin established his own
            medical practice in Bonn. Schmidt devoted his life to the cause of physical education in
            Germany, and the encouragement of regular outdoor physical exercise, games, and sport
            for purposes of general health and fitness. He was the instigator of many movements and
            organizations. In 1873 he founded the Association for Medical-Natural Science, as an
            incorporated body of Bonn University. As a town concillor in Bonn he introduced a school
            medical officer service, and built a special school for the "mentally less gifted." He
            was also an early advocate for naturism.</p>

          <p>Schmidt lectured on hygiene and sports physiology and medicine, and wrote numerous
            academic journal articles and several books (see Bibliography below). For his scholarly
            work and activities he was given awards by many bodies in Germany, Italy, and the United
            States. After 50 years of medical service, he was named the first honorary member of the
            Prussian Gymnastics Union, and received the honorary chairmanship of the German Doctors'
            Union for the Advancement of Physical Exercise. </p>

          <head>Schmidt and the Beethoven-Haus, Bonn</head>
          <p>In 1889, with the newspaper proprietor of the Bonn <title level="j"
              >General-Anzeiger</title>, Hermann Neusser (1839‒1909), he effected the purchase of
            the birth-house of <ref cRef="entity-000055">Beethoven</ref> (Bonngasse 20), and with
            Neusser and others co-founded the Verein <ref cRef="entity-004558">Beethoven-Haus</ref>
            (Association for the Beethoven House), of which he was by 1913 the vice-chairman of the
            board of directors. He published a book on the <ref cRef="entity-004558"
              >Beethoven-Haus</ref> in 1911, expanded to cover the house and archive in 1927. Late
            in life he was accorded the golden medal of the Bonn Male Voice Union for "services to
            music," and was made a Privy Counsellor for Sanitation (<hi rend="italic">Geheimer
              Sanitätsrat</hi>) and honorary citizen of Bonn.</p>
