        <head>Dohnanyi and Schenker</head>
        <p>Dohnanyi had established himself internationally as a pianist in 1898, and had been
          recognized by <ref cRef="entity-000094">Brahms</ref> as a composer in the mid-1890s.
          Although active as a critic at the time, Schenker seems not to have reviewed any of his
          performances, or the performances of his works, in Vienna in the 1890s.</p>

        <p>Schenker's first discussion of Dohnanyi's music is a handwritten note (OC 31/331) dated
          February 2, 1903 about Dohnanyi's <title>Symphony No. 1</title>, in which he says that
          flexibility (<hi rend="italic">Plastik</hi>) borrowed from other composers leads to
          formlessness: <cit>
            <q>Accordingly, flexibility borrowed from Brahms does not work (because it is hindered
              by inflexibility elsewhere [in his music]), nor does Dohnanyi-ian inflexibility evolve
              into flexibility just by importing and interspersing flexible elements from other
              composers. Shallow unoriginality.</q>
          </cit></p>

        <p>At some point, Schenker became acquainted with Dohnanyi, for his diary for August 6, 1906
          records "Evening with Kessler from Pest, Dohnanyi, <ref cRef="entity-000542">Löwe</ref>
          and others, together with <ref cRef="entity-000638">Ochs</ref>." And on March 26, 1908,
          after attending a concert conducted by <ref cRef="entity-000913">Moriz Violin</ref>, he
          reports staying up to 2 a.m. "in company, including that of Dohnanyi."</p>

        <p>Hellmut Federhofer includes Dohnanyi in a long list of conductors and solo
          instrumentalists on whom Schenker held an "equivocal or unfavorable opinion." On November
          9 and 29, 1906 Dohnanyi gave two concerts in the Bösendorfer Recital Hall. At the former,
          Schenker writes that the performance was up to scratch technically in a selection of <ref
            cRef="entity-000094">Brahms</ref> pieces, but failed in a work by Liszt [he probably
          meant <ref cRef="entity-000808">Schumann</ref>'s <ref type="composition"
            cRef="entity-006227"><title level="m">Carnaval</title></ref>] and in the <ref
            cRef="entity-000055">Beethoven</ref>
          <ref type="composition" cRef="entity-001207"><title>Sonata Op. 2, No. 3</title></ref>. At
          the second concert Schenker praised the performance of the Adagio of the <ref
            cRef="entity-000055">Beethoven</ref>
          <ref type="composition" cRef="entity-001205"><title>Sonata Op. 106</title></ref>, but that
          the first and last movements were "performed with only inadequate technical means," and
          the fugue, although with a clear overall conception, was "muddied with pedal." He assessed
          one of the pianist's own compositions, <title level="m">Winterreigen</title>, as <ref
            cRef="entity-000808">Schumann</ref>esque but "lacking the higher, more distinctive
          quality of imagination of the latter." On March 23, 1907, Dohnanyi played <ref
            cRef="entity-000055">Beethoven</ref>'s <ref type="composition" cRef="entity-001199"
              ><title>Fourth Piano Concerto</title></ref> (the work that first made his name) "too
          weakly, without support from the left hand."</p>

        <p>Nor did Schenker's rating of Dohnanyi improve with the years. On November 11, 1927,
          Schenker heard a recital by him on the radio, and commented that <ref cRef="entity-000055"
            >Beethoven</ref>'s <ref type="composition" cRef="entity-001201"><title>Sonata Op.
              101</title></ref> was "completely misunderstood", <ref cRef="entity-000808"
            >Schumann</ref>'s <title>F-sharp minor Sonata</title> was "mainly rushed, in a slapdash
          manner (in places, admittedly, played with a beautiful, intimate tone)." The performance
          of <ref cRef="entity-000094">Brahms</ref>'s <ref type="composition" cRef="entity-001335"
                ><title><hi rend="italic">Intermezzo</hi>, Op. 117, No. 1</title></ref> was
          "unforgivable: the text incorrect, the performance sloppy."</p>
