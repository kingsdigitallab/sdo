      <div>

        <p>German politician and business leader, Chancellor of the Weimar Republic 1922‒23. </p>

        <p>During World War I, Cuno was a civil servant concerned with maintenance of grain
          supplies; he returned to business in 1917. As an economist, he was involved in the
          negotiations over reparations and peace terms in the Versailles Treaty. In November 1922,
          he was appointed to succeed <ref cRef="entity-000969">Joseph Wirth</ref> as Chancellor of
          the Weimar Republic. His government was engaged in passive resistance to French occupation
          of the Ruhr, and was responsible for poor handling of economic problems that led to
          hyperinflation in 1923. After a wave of strikes, Cuno and his cabinet resigned in August
          1923. </p>
