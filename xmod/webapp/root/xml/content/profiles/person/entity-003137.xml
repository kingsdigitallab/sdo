      <div>

        <p>German socialist, co-founder with Rosa Luxemburg of the Spartacus League and the German
          Communist Party. </p>

        <p>Liebknecht was a member of the Second International (1899â€’1914) and founder of the
          Socialist Youth International. He was elected to the Reichstag in 1912 as a member of the
          left wing of the Social Democratic Party. He opposed the Party's policies with regard to
          World War I, and late in 1914, with Rosa Luxemburg and others, founded the Spartacus
          League (Spartacist Union). Imprisoned from 1916 to October 1918, Liebknecht resumed his
          activities, aimed at destabilizing Germany and bringing about revolution. It was
          Liebknecht who, on November 9, 1918, two hours after the proclamation of the Republic
          before the Reichstag by <ref cRef="entity-000765">Philipp Scheidemann</ref>, himself
          proclaimed a "Free Socialist Republic." </p>

        <p>He took part in the Spartacist uprising in Berlin in January 1919, which was crushed by
          remnants of the German imperial army and the Freikorps. He and Luxemburg were captured on
          January 15, tortured and killed. </p>
