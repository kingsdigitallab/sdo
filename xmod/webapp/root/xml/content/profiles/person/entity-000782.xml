      <head>Paul Schiff</head>

      <div>
        <p>Younger brother of <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette Schenker</ref> (née Schiff;
          Kornfeld), thus from 1919 brother-in-law to Heinrich Schenker. His wife was Anna; the
          couple had a daughter, Lisl.</p>

        <p>An entry in Schenker's diary for March 24, 1925 (OJ 3/7, p. 2801) gives insight into his
          state of mind at that time: 
          
          <cit><q>A long letter from Paul's wife; Paul is currently doing a jail
          penalty because of a riotous speech. His poor wife is far from comprehending the gravity
          of the situation, from understanding that Paul is apparently traveling a precipitous path,
          since a feeling of revenge against the state will inevitably overcome him, which will lead
          him to further conflict. His wife describes herself and their child as Paul's "earthly
          weight" but him as a "martyr." Everything underscores the pitiable woman's confusion, as
          the result of confused fundamental views. </q></cit></p>

        <p>Correspondence between the Schenkers and the Schiffs survives as OJ 14/8 (9 items:
          1925-38).</p>
