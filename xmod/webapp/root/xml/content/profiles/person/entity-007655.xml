      <head>Otto Schreier</head>
      <div>

        <p>Distinguished Austrian mathematician, pupil of <ref cRef="entity-000913">Moriz
            Violin</ref> and of <ref cRef="entity-000632">Heinrich Schenker</ref>.</p>
      </div>

        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>The son and only child of architect <ref cRef="entity-000801">Theodor Schreier</ref>
          (1873‒1943) and his wife <ref cRef="entity-003403">Anna</ref> (<hi rend="italic">née</hi>
          Turnau, 1878‒1942), Otto was born in Vienna on March 3, 1901. Showing early talent for
          music as well as mathematics, he had piano lessons with <ref cRef="entity-000913">Moriz
            Violin</ref> during his high school years, continuing with Schenker when <ref
            cRef="entity-000913">Violin</ref> left Vienna for <ref cRef="entity-002589"
            >Hamburg</ref>.</p>

        <p>He studied mathematics at the University of Vienna, receiving his doctorate in 1923. The
          Jewish quota having been filled at Vienna University, he relocated to <ref
            cRef="entity-002589">Hamburg</ref>, with its outstanding mathematics faculty, where his
          original work and his teaching could flourish in his position as Privatdozent. In <ref
            cRef="entity-002589">Hamburg</ref> he met and soon married <ref cRef="entity-007656"
            >Edith Ascher</ref> (<hi rend="italic">née</hi> Jacoby), like him a serious musical
          amateur who studied the piano with <ref cRef="entity-000913">Moriz Violin</ref>. In 1929
          he was offered and accepted a position as Professor at the University of Rostock.
          Tragically he fell ill and a brilliant career was cut short by his untimely death, less
          than a month before the birth of his and <ref cRef="entity-007656">Edith</ref>'s daughter
            <ref cRef="entity-007504">Irene</ref>.</p>

        <head>Otto Schreier and Moriz Violin</head>
        <p>As a child, Otto proved so gifted in music that he commenced piano lessons with <ref
            cRef="entity-000913">Moriz Violin</ref> c.1914. These continued until 1921, when <ref
            cRef="entity-000913">Violin</ref> relocated to <ref cRef="entity-002589">Hamburg</ref>,
          at which point he recommended Otto to <ref cRef="entity-000632">Heinrich Schenker</ref>.
          After Otto himself moved to <ref cRef="entity-002589">Hamburg</ref> in 1923 he resumed his
          studies with <ref cRef="entity-000913">Violin</ref>. Evidently Otto was intimate with the
            <ref cRef="entity-002938">Violin family</ref>, as evidenced by a letter from <ref
            cRef="entity-000913">Violin</ref> to <ref cRef="entity-000632">Schenker</ref> where,
          speaking of his son, he wrote: "Little <ref cRef="entity-000912">Karl</ref> [...] was very
          upset by the death of Professor Schreier" (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-14-45_79"
            >OJ 14/45, [79]</ref>, June 16, 1929).</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Otto Schreier and Heinrich Schenker</head>
        <p><ref cRef="entity-000801">Theodor Schreier</ref> first approached <ref
            cRef="entity-000632">Schenker</ref> for lessons on behalf of his son on September 16,
          1920. Both parents returned with Otto five days later, when <ref cRef="entity-000632"
            >Schenker</ref> accepted him for one lesson in the first instance. The 1920/21
          lessonbook entry (undated) suggests that more than one lesson took place: <cit>
            <q>Mozart Sonata in A major; Beethoven Bagatelles [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] in F
              major; Beethoven Op. 2, No. 2.</q>
          </cit>
        </p>

        <p>In January 1921 <ref cRef="entity-000801">Theodor</ref> asked for a continuation, which
          seems to have been granted; but in September of that year <ref cRef="entity-000632"
            >Schenker</ref> stipulated an increase in fee to 4,000 Kronen, at which point <ref
            cRef="entity-000801">Theodor</ref> withdrew his son. In 1924, upon hearing that Otto had
          completed his doctorate, and again in 1927, <ref cRef="entity-000632">Schenker</ref>
          acknowledged him in his diary as his "former pupil." On June 5, 1929, <ref
            cRef="entity-000632">Schenker</ref>'s diary recorded shock at the notice of Otto's
          death.</p>
