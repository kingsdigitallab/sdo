      <head>Jenny [Jenni] Eissler</head>
      <div>

        <p>Viennese patron of Schenker over many years, up to 1909. </p>

        <p>She may have been be the Jenny (or Jenni) Weiss (birth/death dates unknown), whose family
          owned the Gerson Spitzer company, wholesale merchants, and who was married to Moritz
          Eissler (1845‒1919).</p>

        <head>Jenny Eissler and Schenker</head>
        <p>The <ref cRef="entity-003218">Eissler family</ref> is first mentioned in Schenker's diary
          on June 3, 1906 ("To Heiligenkreuz with the Eissler family") (OJ 1/5, p. 13). Thereafter,
          Schenker visited her home on many occasions, often with lunch or dinner; on at least one
          occasion music was played ("Dec 16[, 1906] Evening with Mrs Eissler, with Barthlomey
          (clarinet) quintets by Mozart and Brahms played; merry evening": OJ 1/5, p. 30); and on
          another went with Mr and Mrs Eissler to a performance of Bernard Shaw's <title level="m"
            >Man and Superman</title> (of which he provides a lengthy critique) (OJ 1/6, p. 39).</p>

        <p>On other occasions, money was either received or discussed, including a request for 250
          Florins for Schenker's friend <ref cRef="entity-000913">Moriz Violin</ref> (OJ 1/6, p.
          40). Mrs Eissler gave Schenker presents, not always welcome: "Friday, Dec 21[, 1906]
          Christmas present from Mrs Eissler: Brahms Correspondence and wine: on both accounts very
          agreeable" (OJ 1/5, p. 31); "Dec 25[, 1907] Christmas. A picture of C. P. E. Bach (from
          Mrs Deutsch) gives me profound pleasure. By contrast, displeasure at another gift
          (Massenet autograph) from Mrs Eissler" (OJ 1/6, p. 54).</p>

        <p>The last recorded diary entry seems to mark the break-down of relations: <cit>
            <q>July 1[, 1909] First signs of bad behavior on Mrs Eissler's part. The extraordinary
              audacity of the stinking rich. The lady voluntarily offers financial help. She is
              importunate with it in front of witnesses and in front of me myself, but no sooner do
              I name the sum of my counterproposal ‒ the figure of 1,200 Florins, representing a
              payment that, when divided up over the many, many years of our acquaintance would
              barely have amounted to 10 Florins a month (1,200 ÷ 10 = 120) ‒ than she straightway
              looks right through me as if it were <hi rend="italic">I</hi> who had actually asked
                <hi rend="italic">her</hi> for help. (OJ 1/8, p. 100)</q>
          </cit> In his marginal calculation, Schenker first writes "1,200 ÷ 15," then changes it to
          "1,200 ÷ 10," as if he were uncertain as to whether their acquaintance went back fifteen
          years (to 1894) or ten (to 1899).</p>
