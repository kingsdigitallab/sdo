      <head>Jenny [Jenni] Eißler [Eissler] (<hi rend="italic">née</hi> Weiss)</head>
      <div>

        <p>Viennese patron of Schenker's over many years, up to 1909. </p>

        <p>A member of the <ref cRef="entity-003218">Eißler family</ref>, owners of larger timber
          businesses, she was the daughter of Adolf Baruch Weiss and Evan Kanitz, and the wife of
            <ref cRef="entity-006229">Moriz Eissler</ref>, mother of Else Mautner, Alfred Eissler,
          Margarete von Scily and <ref cRef="entity-006230">Georg Eissler</ref>.</p>

      </div>

        <head>Jenny Eissler and Schenker</head>
        <p>The <ref cRef="entity-003218">Eissler family</ref> is first mentioned in Schenker's diary
          on June 3, 1906 ("To Heiligenkreuz with the Eissler family") (OJ 1/5, p. 13). Thereafter,
          Schenker visited her home on many occasions, often with lunch or dinner; on at least one
          occasion music was played ("Dec 16[, 1906] Evening with Mrs Eissler, with <ref
            cRef="entity-000039">Bartholomey</ref> (clarinet) quintets by Mozart and Brahms played;
          jolly evening": OJ 1/5, p. 30); and on another went with Mr and Mrs Eissler to a
          performance of <ref cRef="entity-000824">Bernard Shaw</ref>'s <title level="m">Man and
            Superman</title> (of which he provides a lengthy critique) (OJ 1/6, p. 39).</p>

        <p>On other occasions, money was either received or discussed, including a request for 250
          Florins for Schenker's friend <ref cRef="entity-000913">Moriz Violin</ref> (OJ 1/6, p.
          40). Mrs Eissler gave Schenker presents, not always welcome: "Friday, Dec 21[, 1906]
          Christmas present from Mrs Eissler: Brahms Correspondence and wine: on both accounts very
          agreeable" (OJ 1/5, p. 31); "Dec 25[, 1907] Christmas. A picture of <ref
            cRef="entity-000025">C. P. E. Bach</ref> (from <ref cRef="entity-000165">Mrs
            Deutsch</ref>) gives me profound pleasure. By contrast, displeasure at another gift
          (Massenet autograph) from Mrs Eissler" (OJ 1/6, p. 54).</p>

        <p>The last recorded diary entry seems to mark the break-down of relations: <cit>
            <q>July 1[, 1909] First signs of bad behavior on Mrs Eissler's part. The extraordinary
              audacity of the filthy rich. The lady voluntarily offers financial help. She is
              importunate with it in front of witnesses and in front of me myself, but no sooner do
              I work out the sum of my counterproposal ‒ the figure of 1,200 Florins, representing a
              payment that, when divided up over the many, many years of our acquaintance would
              barely have amounted to 10 Florins a month (1,200 ÷ 10 = 120 ÷ 12) ‒ than she
              straightway makes herself scarce as if it were indeed I who had actually asked her for
              help. (OJ 1/8, p. 100)</q>
          </cit></p>

        <p>In his marginal calculation, Schenker first writes "1,200 ÷ 15," then changes it to
          "1,200 ÷ 10," as if he were uncertain as to whether their acquaintance went back fifteen
          years (to 1894) or ten (to 1899).</p>
