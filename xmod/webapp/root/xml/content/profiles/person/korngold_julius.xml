      <head>Julius Korngold</head>
      <div>
        <p>Eminent Austrian music critic, conservative in outlook; Hanslick's successor at the <ref
            cRef="neue_freie_presse">
            <title level="j">Neue Freie Presse</title>
          </ref>, where he wielded considerable influence between 1902 and 1934 as a writer of
          reviews and front-page feuilletons. He was father of the composer, Erich Wolfgang
          Korngold. </p>

        <head>Julius Korngold and Schenker</head>
        <p>In 1906, Schenker included Korngold in the list of recipients of a complimentary copy of
          his <title level="m">Harmonielehre</title> (CA 56, 58, 60). In 1912, he wrote of a
          campaign by the pianists Godowsky, Rosenthal, and Leschetiztky against Korngold's
          criticisms, this campaign being related to the body that Schenker himself tried to set up,
          the "<ref cRef="organization_artists">Organization of Creative and Performing
          Artists</ref>".</p>
        <p>Schenker once included him disparagingly among the "ranks of those noble hermeneuticists"
          (OJ 15/34, [3], January 14, 1918). As a regular reader of the <title level="j">Neue Freie
            Presse</title>, Schenker often commented in his diary and in correspondence, usually
          acidly, on Korngold's pronouncements. Federhofer remarks that Schenker "was against music
          journalism ... He knew [some of] its Viennese representatives, such as Max Graf and Robert
          Hirschfeld, personally, others, such as Julius Korngold, against whom he repeatedly
          expressed negative opinions, only from their newpaper articles and reviews." (p. 358). </p>
        <p>One calling card from Julius Korngold to Schenker (1902) survives as OJ 12/19. </p>
