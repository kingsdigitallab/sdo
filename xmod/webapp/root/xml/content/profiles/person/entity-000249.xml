        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p> Frenssen studied theology at the Universities of Tübingen, Berlin, and Kiel, after which
          he became a pastor. He rapidly became a successful novelist with <title level="m">Die
            Sandgräfin</title> (1896) and <title level="m">Jörn Uhl</title> (1901). In 1914, he was
          a candidate for the Nobel Prize in literature. His <title level="m">Peter Moors Fahrt nach
            Südwest</title> (1906) showed early signs of his racial ideas. He became a member of
          Friedrich Naumann's National Socialist Society in 1896, and spoke out for Germany's need
          to have its own colonies, becoming interested in contemporary writings on racial biology.
          From 1923, his works began to show marked signs of antisemitism, and from the later 1920s
          on he was a supporter of Hitler and his euthanasia policies. His racial beliefs caused him
          to turn away from Christian religion. </p>
