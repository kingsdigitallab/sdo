        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Rudorff was professor at the Berlin Hochschule für Musik 1867-1910. He was
          involved in the collected edition of Mozart's and Chopin's works, and a member of the
          editorial committee of the <title level="s">Denkmäler Deutscher
        Tonkunst</title>.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Rudorff and Schenker</head>

        <p>Schenker sent him copies of his <title level="m">Harmonielehre</title>, J. S. Bach,
            <title level="m">Chromatic Fantasy &amp; Fugue</title>, <title level="m">Kontrapunkt
            1</title>, and <title level="m">Beethovens Neunte Sinfonie</title>, and the two men
          corresponded vigorously between January 1908 and August 1912. In thanking Schenker for the
          first of these works, Rudorff remarks: "When I put together what you have told me of your
          plans as a whole with what I have now read in your <title level="m">Harmonielehre</title>,
          I believe and hope that you are the long-awaited one destined to hurl the burning torch
          into the Tower of Babel [i.e. Wagner's world]." (OJ 3/37, 3). The two men disagreed
          strongly on the merits of Gluck, whom Rudorff rated highly, but agreed in their critiques
          of Wagner and Bruckner; they were in agreement that a "disintegration" was taking place
          "socially and morally," and that an artistic regeneration was unlikely to occur
          (Federhofer, pp.205-06). These sentiments were reflected in the <title level="m">Niedergang der Kompositionskunst</title> (Decline of the Art of Composition), on which
          Schenker was working and set great store at the time, though it ultimately remained
          unpublished. </p>

          Rudorff : 7 items), OJ 13/37 (1908-10: Rudorff to Schenker : 13 items), and OJ 59/15
          (inventory in Oswald Jonas's hand). and from Elisabeth Rudorff to Schenker as OJ 13/36
