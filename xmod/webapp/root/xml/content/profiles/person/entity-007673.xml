        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Fritz Stiedry studied composition under <ref cRef="entity-000562">Mandyczewski</ref> at
          the <ref cRef="entity-002591">Vienna Conservatory</ref>, and then graduated from Vienna
          University with a doctorate in Law. His abilities as a conductor came to the attention of
            <ref cRef="entity-000556">Gustav Mahler</ref>, and he was appointed an assistant
          conductor at the <ref cRef="entity-002778">Vienna Court Opera</ref> in 1907. Thereafter he
          had a succession of appointments culminating in the Kassel Court Opera, where he was chief
          conductor in 1913, and then first conductor at the Berlin Opera 1914‒23, returning to
          Vienna in 1923, where he conducted the world premiere of <ref cRef="entity-000798"
            >Schoenberg</ref>'s <title level="m">Die glückliche Hand</title> at the Volksoper in
          1924. Following that, he went to the Berlin Städtische Oper 1928‒33, during which period
          he became President of the International Society for Contemporary Music. When <ref cRef="entity-003109">Hitler</ref> came
          to power in Germany in 1933, Stiedry moved to Leningrad to conduct the Leningrad
          Philharmonic Orchestra 1934‒37.</p>

        <p>In 1938 he emigrated to the <ref cRef="entity-002510">USA</ref>, becoming the conductor
          of the New Friends of Music Orchestra in <ref cRef="entity-002873">New York</ref>, with
          which he conducted the world premiere of <ref cRef="entity-000798">Schoenberg</ref>'s
            <title>Chamber Symphony No. 2</title> in 1940. After World War II, he went first to the
          Chicago Civic Opera, and from 1946 to 1958 conducted regularly at the Metropolitan Opera
          in <ref cRef="entity-002873">New York</ref>.</p>

        <p>As the conductor of the New Friends of Music Orchestra in <ref cRef="entity-002873">New
            York</ref>, he asked <ref cRef="entity-000798">Schoenberg</ref> for an orchestral piece,
          prompting the latter to finish his <title>Chamber Symphony No.2</title>, begun in 1906 and
          completed in America in 1939, the first performance of which took place in <ref
            cRef="entity-002873">New York</ref> on December 14, 1940. <ref cRef="entity-000913"
            >Moriz Violin</ref> mentions Stiedry favorably in a letter to <ref cRef="entity-000798"
            >Schoenberg</ref> of December 19, 1940 and refers to him again on April 14, May 21, and
          July 20, 1941 (LC ASC 27/45, [2], [27], [28], [29]), when he may have been trying to
          involve him in plans that he was making for an institute in <ref cRef="entity-002921">San
            Francisco</ref>.</p>
