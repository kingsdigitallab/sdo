        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Paul Wittgenstein was the son of Karl Wittgenstein and <ref cRef="wittgenstein_leopold">Leopoldine (Poldi) Wittgenstein</ref>, and older brother of the philosopher Ludwig
          Wittgenstein. A pupil of Leschetizky and Labor, Wittgenstein made his public debut in 1913
          in Vienna. During World War I he fought on the eastern front, where he lost his right arm;
          he was prisoner of war in Siberia, and was repatriated in 1916. Thereafter he built a
          career as a left-handed pianist. He commissioned works from, among others, Richard
          Strauss, Ravel, and Prokofiev, of most of which he gave world premieres. He settled in New
          York in 1938.</p>

        <head>Wittgenstein and Schenker</head>
        <p>The Wittgenstein family had a large collection of musical manuscripts, particularly many
          by Brahms, but including also J. S. Bach and Beethoven, and it was in connection with the
          autograph manuscript of Beethoven's Piano Sonata in E major, Op. 109 that Schenker seems
          first to have come into contact with him on November 12, 1912 (OJ 1/11, p. 277).</p>
