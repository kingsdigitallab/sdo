      <div>

        <p>Hotel proprietor in <rs key="entity-002292" type="place">Galtür</rs>, in the Austrian
          Tyrol; burgomaster of the village 1928‒38. </p>

        <head>Biographical summary</head>
        <p>Adolf Türtscher was one of the four children of <rs key="entity-002927" type="person"
            >Franz Anton</rs> and <rs key="entity-002928" type="person">Emerenzia</rs> Türtscher,
          who owned the small hotels Rössle and Fluchthorn in Galtür. In the early 1920s, Adolf took
          over the management of the Fluchthorn, which he expanded to a full-scale hotel. He
          purchased an automobile with which he began offering personal transport, which later
          turned into a scheduled private line. </p>

        <p>Türtscher involved himself in all branches of the newly developing tourism of Galtür.
          From the first band to most of the societies, he worked as initiator, leader, or energetic
          promoter. His two secretaries, who were employed in the Hotel Fluchthorn, produced the
          village brochures and recruited guests from all over Europe. They were the precursors of
          the Galtür tourist agency. </p>

        <p>During his time as burgomaster, Galtür developed into a sizeable resort for foreign
          tourists. That this was even possible in the inter-war period is to be attributed in good
          part to his far-sightedness and the good relations that he established. </p>

        <head>Adolf Türtscher and the Schenkers</head>

        <p>Heinrich and Jeanette Schenker spent their summers at the Hotel Fluchthorn in 1921, 1922,
          1923, and 1924. They also corresponded with Adolf Türtscher during Heinrich's teaching
          season, and one fragment of a letter from Adolf to Schenker survives as OC 10/211 (no
          date). </p>
