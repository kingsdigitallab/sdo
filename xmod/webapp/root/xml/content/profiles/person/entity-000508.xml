      <head>Ludwig Landshoff</head>
      <div>

        <p>German musicologist, editor, and conductor. </p>

      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Landshoff studied composition with Heinrich Urban, musicology with Max Friedlander and
          Oskar Fleischer at Berlin University, and Adolf Sandberger at Munich University.
          Thereafter, he served as opera conductor at the theaters in Aachen (1902–04), Kiel
          (1912–13), Breslau (1913–15), and Würzburg (1915–20), and music director of the Munich
          Bachverein (1918–28), moving to Berlin in 1928, then to Italy in 1936, Paris in 1938, and
          New York in 1941, where he spent the last few months of his life.</p>

        <p>He is best known for his research into vocal music of the 17th and 18th centuries. He
          produced the five-volume series <title level="s">Alte Meister des Bel Canto</title>, and
          also edited instrumental music by C. P. E Bach, J. S. Bach, J. C. Bach, and others. He
          prepared scrupulous Urtext editions of works, including the two- and three-part inventions
          and <title level="m">Musical Offering</title> of J. S. Bach, published by C. F. Peters,
          both with extensive critical commentaries, and produced similar editions of the
            <title>English Suites</title> and the <title level="m">Well-tempered Clavier</title>
          that were in production in 1939 but never published. Late in his career, he did much
          research into the music of Vivaldi.</p>

      <div>
        <head>Landshoff and Schenker</head>
        <p>The two men probably never met. From 1934, one letter from Schenker survives thanking
          Landshoff for sending his edition of the two- and three-part inventions (Kassler 1).
          Landshoff is also mentioned in correspondence between Schenker and Oswald Jonas: OJ 12/6,
          [26], December 10, 1933, OJ 5/18, 34, January 16, 1934, and OC 44/21, September 18, 1934.
