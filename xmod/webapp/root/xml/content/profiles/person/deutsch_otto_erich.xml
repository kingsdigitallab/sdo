      <head>Otto Erich Deutsch</head>

      <div>
        <p>Austrian biographer, bibliographer, art historian, and musicologist.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Deutsch studied history of literature and art at the Universities of Vienna and Graz, and
          worked as an art critic 1908-09. He served in the Austrian Army during World War I, worked
          for a time in the book trade, and became music librarian to the private collector and
          musicologist Anthony van Hoboken (1926-35). His first major work was his documentary
          biography of Schubert. In 1928, he was given the title of Professor for his services to
          the centenary of Schubert's death. Deutsch left Vienna in 1939 for England, becoming a
          British citizen in 1947, but returning to Vienna in 1952. While in England, he co-authored
          the standard catalogue of Schubert's works, and made important contributions to music
          bibliography. Thereafter, he applied the principles of the documentary biography to Handel
          (1955) and Mozart (1961).</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Deutsch and Schenker</head>
        <p>Deutsch and Schenker shared a belief in the ability of original documents to speak for
          themselves, as is exemplified by the former's volume on the original editions of
          Schubert's Goethe songs (1926), his facsimile of Schubert's diary (1928), and his edition
          of Mozart's early self-catalog (1956), as well as the transcriptions in his documentary
          biographies.</p>

        <p>Deutsch was the general editor of a series of "connoisseur prints" published by Universal
          Edition, to which Schenker contributed a facsimile edition of Beethoven's "Moonlight"
          Sonata (1921) with reproductions of three sketches, and a Foreword (contract OC 52/238).</p>

        <p>The earliest document linking Deutsch and Schenker is a press announcement by the
          Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna, dated September 15, 1912, announcing a series of
          public lectures, the list of speakers including both men (OJ 11/22, [4]). First reference
          to Otto Erich Deutsch in Schenker's diary appears to occur on February 24, 1913, when
          after attending a lecture by Schenker's pupil <ref cRef="deutsch_sofie">Mrs. Sofie
          Deutsch</ref>--no relation to Otto Erich--Heinrich and Jeanette (Kornfeld) spent the
          evening in company with Sofie and Otto Erich (OJ 1/12, p. 316). Thereafter, Schenker met
          him not infrequently at the houses of Sofie Deutsch and her brother Fritz Mendl (e.g. OJ
          1/12, p. 327; 1/13, p. 473; 1/14, p. 527).</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Correspondence with Schenker</head>

        <p>The Schenkers' correspondence with Deutsch and his wife Hanna, of which the earliest
          items date from 1913, continued to 1939. There are approximately 300 known items of
          correspondence, surviving in Vienna (WSLB), New York (in OC Files 12, 18, 24, 39, 44, 50,
          54, and A), Riverside, California (OJ 5/9; 10/3), Berkeley, California (BerkAE, [4]), and
          in private hands. Between 1927 and 1932, Deutsch was involved in some intermediary
          capacity (including handling proof-corrections) with the publication by Drei Masken
          Verlag, Munich, of Schenker's <title level="j">Das Meisterwerk in der Musik</title>, and
          this accounts for the bulk of their written communications.</p>

        <p>Many offprints and clippings of articles by Deutsch are preserved among Schenker's
          papers, including several on Schenker's desk at the time of his death (OC 30).</p>
