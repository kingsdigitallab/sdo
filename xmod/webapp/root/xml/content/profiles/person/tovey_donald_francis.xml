      <head>Donald Francis Tovey</head>
      <div>
        <p>English pianist, conductor, and writer on music.</p>
        <p>Having trained first as a pianist with Sophie Weisse and studied Classics at Oxford
          University, Tovey embarked on a career as concert pianist in 1894, establishing an
          association with Joseph Joachim and the Joachim Quartet that lasted for many years, and
          later working with others such as Pablo Casals and Julius R&#xF6;ntgen.</p>
        <p>In 1914, he was appointed Reid Professor of Music at Edinburgh University, where, in
          addition to teaching, he founded and conducted the Reid Orchestra. His program notes for
          the concerts of that orchestra were later republished as his <title level="m">Essays in
            Musical Analysis</title>. He published editions with commentary of Bach's <title
            level="m">Well-tempered Clavier</title> (1924) and the Beethoven piano sonatas (1931).</p>
        <p>There is no correspondence between Schenker and Tovey, and Schenker seems to have been
          relatively unaware of his work.</p>
