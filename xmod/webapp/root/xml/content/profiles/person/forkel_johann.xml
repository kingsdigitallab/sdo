      <head>Johann Nikolaus Forkel </head>
      <div>
        <p>German music historian, bibliographer, biographer, and organist, considered one of the
          founders of historical musicology. </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>The son of a cobbler, Forkel received his early musical training, especially in keyboard
          playing, from Johann Henrich Schulthesius. In other aspects of his music education he was
          self-taught, especially in music theory. In his teens he served as a singer in Lüneberg,
          and studied law for two years at the Georg August University of Göttingen. He remained
          associated with that university for more than 50 years, holding various posts, including
          instructor in music theory, organist, keyboard teacher, and eventually overall director of
          music at the university. In 1787, he received an honorary doctorate of philosophy from the
          institution. </p>

        <p>He was an admirer of Johann Sebastian Bach, whose music he did much to popularize. He
          wrote the first biography of Bach (in 1802), a work that is of particular value today
          since he was able to correspond directly with Bach's sons Carl Philipp Emanuel and Wilhelm
          Friedemann and obtain much information that might otherwise have been lost. Forkel also
          projected a complete edition of Bach's works, but this was not realized in his lifetime.
          He also wrote a history of music (1788, 1801). </p>

        <head>Schenker and Forkel</head>
        <p>Schenker's library, at the end of his life, contained a copy of the <title level="m">Allgemeine Literatur
          der Musik</title> and both volumes of the <title>Allgemeine Geschichte der Musik</title>. His diary for July 1918
          records that a pupil of his, Evelina Pairamall, sent him "a small volume of Forkel's
          <title>Kleine Bibliothek</title>" (OJ 2/11, p. 917). </p>
