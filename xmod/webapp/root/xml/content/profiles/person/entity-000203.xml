      <head>Manolo (Menachem) Elias</head>
      <div>

        <p>Polish-born, Jewish medical doctor in Vienna; sister of <ref cRef="entity-000201">Angi
            Elias</ref>.</p>

        <p>Manolo Elias was the son of Heinrich Menachem Elias (1841‒1901) and <ref
            cRef="entity-000202">Rachel Elias</ref> (<hi rend="italic">née</hi> Russo) (1853‒1934).
          He had six elder sisters and one younger brother. He and his sister <ref
            cRef="entity-000201">Angi Elias</ref> were evidently close; after the death of their
          mother, she states that she will remain in Vienna in part because she does not want to
          leave Manolo "alone in his present isolation" (<ref type="correspondence"
            cRef="OJ-10-18_9">OJ 10/18, [9]</ref>). He presumably lived with his parents as a child
          in Vienna's first district at Augustengasse 4 and in the 1920s at Gölsdorfgasse 4. He had
          qualified as a medical doctor by at the latest 1917. By 1934 he was working privately and
          living at Vienna I, Wallnerstraße 2, where he remained until at least 1939, after which he
          disappears from the Vienna street directory. He lived until October 15, 1943, and was
          buried in Vienna, so clearly escaped the Nazis.</p>

      <div>
        <head>Manolo Elias and Heinrich Schenker</head>
        <p>Schenker's diary shows that Manolo featured in conversations between his <ref
            cRef="entity-000201">sister</ref> and Schenker. The two men must have met on occasions,
          the only one that we know from Schenker's diary being at a Toscanini concert on May 19,
          1930.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Correspondence</head>
        <p>The sole surviving item of correspondence between the two men is that from Manolo to
          Schenker: a note of thanks (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-10-19_1">OJ 10/19,
            [1]</ref>) for a letter of condolence that Schenker sent to him on August 18, 1934 on
          the death of his <ref cRef="entity-000202">mother</ref>. Schenker's diary shows, however,
          that Manolo had previously written a letter of condolence to Schenker on the death of the
          latter's <ref cRef="entity-000773">mother</ref>, to which Schenker replied on December 15,
          1917. Manolo also sent Christmas or New Year's greetings and birthday best wishes to
          Schenker.</p>
