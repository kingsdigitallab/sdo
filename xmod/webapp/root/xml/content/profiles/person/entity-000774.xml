      <head>Moriz [Maurice; Mozio; Moses] Schenker</head>

      <div>
        <p>Younger brother of Heinrich Schenker, and also of <ref cRef="entity-000319">Shifre</ref>
          and <ref cRef="entity-000775">Wilhelm</ref> Schenker; youngest child of <ref
            cRef="entity-000772">Johann</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000773">Julia</ref> Schenker. He
          lived in <ref cRef="entity-002394">Baden bei Wien</ref>, and was married to Lisl (Liesl). </p>

        <p>A banker with the <ref cRef="entity-002432">Österreichische Länderbank</ref> (Austrian
          Provincial Bank), Moriz Schenker was stationed in Egypt in the early years of the century
          (he later remarked: "Egypt is my second home ... unfortunately a continuous life there is
          impossible." ‒ diary OJ 3/9, p. 3003, Nov 17, 1926); later he worked at the Vienna branch
          in the Rumanian room, which entailed much travel, during which in November-December 1918
          he was interned in Bucharest. In 1914, there is reference to his receiving a "decoration"
            (<hi rend="italic">Dekorierung</hi>) (OJ 1/16, p. 707, September 16, 1914). In November
          1924, he apparently moved to the Treuga Bank. He played the violin well enough to have
          played informally with Heinrich.</p>

        <p>Moriz and Lisl had two children: <ref cRef="entity-003067">Helga</ref> and <ref
            cRef="entity-000769">Georg</ref>. First signs of difficulty in the couple's marriage
          came when in mid-July 1929 Moriz informed Schenker that Lisl had "moved [from
          Baden Baden] to Vienna" (OJ 4/2, pp. 3353-3354), after which it emerged that she had left
          him for <ref cRef="entity-004819">Leopold Richtera</ref> (OJ 4/2, pp. 3380‒3381). Moriz
          apparently committed suicide in 1936.</p>

        <p>He (together with his eldest brother Wilhelm) contributed money to the upkeep of his
          mother, Julia Schenker, at least from January 1914 onwards. Later, he looked after
          Schenker's financial affairs; and during the legal proceedings between Heinrich and <ref
            cRef="entity-002408">Universal Edition</ref> in 1925 he acted as intermediary to the
          disputing parties in a crucial meeting, and the agreed compensatory payments from UE to
          Heinrich were to be paid into the account of Moriz Schenker, who by that time had risen to
          the rank of General Director of the Vienna branch of the bank. However, on June 4, 1929
          Schenker gave notice of intention to withdraw half of the financial resources that were in
          his brother's keeping (OJ 4/2, p. 3344), and subsequently invested them in US dollars
          (ibid, p. 3352, July 8, 1929).</p>

        <p>Being relatively wealthy, he fell victim to Schenker's general detestation of "the rich."
          For example, Moriz's behavior on the occasion of his decoration (see above) was dubbed "an
          unequaled piece of Schenker shenanigens" (<hi rend="italic">ein Schenkerei
            ohnegleichen</hi>) and "damnable." A retrospective remark in 1922 refers to the fact the
          "Already during my earliest years, because I had to support mother, sister, younger
          brother (today the so ungrateful billionaire) and nieces by giving piano lessons ..." (DLA
          69.930/10, September 25, 1922).</p>

        <head>Correspondence with Heinrich and Others; Photographs</head>

        <p>Correspondence from Moriz to Heinrich Schenker survives as OJ 14/5 (1918-30: 41 items,
          including correspondence to Julia Schenker, 1912-14) and OC 54/31 and 32 (1925), A/284 and
          285 (1934). Some correspondence with Universal Edition exists as OC 52/466 and 467 (1924),
          and with Schenker's attorney <ref cRef="entity-000048">Theodor Baumgarten</ref>, OC 52/703
          (1925), regarding the dispute with UE. OJ 35/8 contains "financial transactions between
          Heinrich Schenker and Moriz Schenker, Anny Wollner and Drei Masken-Verlag, 1922-31."</p>

        <p>Two photographic portraits survive as OJ 72/18, Nos. 1 (Moriz in military uniform with
          wife, c. 1897) and 2 (Moriz alone, c. 1901).</p>
