      <head>Moriz [Maurice; Mozio; Moses] Schenker</head>

      <div>
        <p>Younger brother of Heinrich Schenker, and also of <ref cRef="entity-000319">Shifre</ref>
          and <ref cRef="entity-000775">Wilhelm</ref> Schenker; youngest child of <ref
            cRef="entity-000772">Johann</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000773">Julia</ref> Schenker. He
          lived in <ref cRef="entity-002394">Baden bei Wien</ref>, and was married to Lisl (Liesl). </p>

        <p>A banker with the <ref cRef="entity-002432">Österreichische Länderbank</ref> (Austrian
          Provincial Bank), Moriz Schenker was stationed in Egypt in the early years of the century;
          later he worked at the Vienna branch in the Rumanian room, which entailed much travel,
          during which in November-December 1918 he was interned in Bucharest. In 1914, there is
          reference to his receiving a "decoration" (<hi rend="italic">Dekorierung</hi>) (OJ 1/16,
          p. 707, September 16, 1914). In November 1924, he apparently moved to the Treuga Bank. He
          played the violin well enough to have played informally with Heinrich. He apparently
          committed suicide in 1936 when Lisl left him.</p>

        <p>Moriz and Lisl had two children: <ref cRef="entity-003067">Helga</ref> and <ref
            cRef="entity-000769">Georg</ref>. </p>

        <head>Relationship with Heinrich</head>

        <p>He (together with his eldest brother Wilhelm) contributed money to the upkeep of his
          mother, Julia Schenker, at least from January 1914 onwards. Later, he looked after
          Schenker's financial affairs; and during the legal proceedings between Heinrich and <ref
            cRef="entity-002408">Universal Edition</ref> in 1925 he acted as intermediary to the
          disputing parties in a crucial meeting, and the agreed compensatory payments from UE to
          Heinrich were to be paid into the account of Moriz Schenker, who by that time had risen to
          the rank of General Director of the Vienna branch of the bank.</p>

        <p>Being relatively wealthy, he fell victim to Schenker's general detestation of "the rich."
          For example, Moriz's behavior on the occasion of his decoration (see above) was dubbed "an
          unequaled piece of Schenker shenanigens" (<hi rend="italic">ein Schenkerei
            ohnegleichen</hi>) and "damnable." A retrospective remark in 1922 refers to the fact the
          "Already during my earliest years, because I had to support mother, sister, younger
          brother (today the so ungrateful billionaire) and nieces by giving piano lessons ..." (DLA
          69.930/10, September 25, 1922).</p>

        <head>Correspondence with Heinrich and Others; Photographs</head>

        <p>Correspondence from Moriz to Heinrich Schenker survives as OJ 14/5 (1918-30: 41 items,
          including correspondence to Julia Schenker, 1912-14) and OC 54/31 and 32 (1925), A/284 and
          285 (1934). Some correspondence with Universal Edition exists as OC 52/466 and 467 (1924),
          and with Schenker's attorney <ref cRef="entity-000048">Theodor Baumgarten</ref>, OC 52/703
          (1925), regarding the dispute with UE. OJ 35/8 contains "financial transactions between
          Heinrich Schenker and Moriz Schenker, Anny Wollner and Drei Masken-Verlag, 1922-31."</p>

        <p>Two photographic portraits survive as OJ 72/18, Nos. 1 (Moriz in military uniform with
          wife, c. 1897) and 2 (Moriz alone, c. 1901).</p>
