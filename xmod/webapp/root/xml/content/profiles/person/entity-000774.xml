      <head>Moriz [Maurice; Mozio; Moses] Schenker</head>

      <div>
        <p>Younger brother of Heinrich Schenker, and also of <ref cRef="guttmann_sophie_nee">Shifre</ref> and <ref cRef="schenker_wilhelm">Wilhelm</ref> Schenker, youngest child of
            <ref cRef="schenker_johann">Johann</ref> and <ref cRef="schenker_julia">Julia</ref>
          Schenker. He lived in Baden bei Wien, and was married to Lisl.</p>

        <p>A banker with the Österreichische Länderbank (Austrian Provincial Bank)
          he worked in the Rumanian room, which involved much travel, during which in
          November-December 1918 he was interned in Bucharest. In 1914, there is reference to his
          receiving a "decoration" (<hi rend="italic">Dekorierung</hi>) (OJ 1/16, p. 707, September
          16, 1914).</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Relationship with Heinrich</head>

        <p>He (together with his eldest brother Wilhelm) contributed money to the upkeep of his
          mother, Julia Schenker, at least from January 1914 onwards. Later, he looked after
          Schenker's financial affairs; and during the legal proceedings between Heinrich and <ref cRef="universal_edition">Universal Edition</ref> in 1925 he acted as intermediary to the
          disputing parties in a crucial meeting, and the agreed compensatory payments from UE to
          Heinrich were to be paid into the account of Moriz Schenker, who by that time had risen to
          the rank of General Director of the Vienna branch of the bank.</p>

        <p>Being realatively wealthy, he fell victim to Schenker's general detestation of "the
          rich." For example, Moriz's behavior on the occasion of his decoration (see above) was
          dubbed "an unequaled piece of Schenker shenanigens" (<hi rend="italic">ein Schenkerei
            ohnegleichen</hi>) and "damnable." A retrospective remark in 1922 refers to the fact the
          "in my earliest years, I had to maintain by means of giving piano lessons my mother,
          sister, younger brother (the millionaire, nowadays so ungrateful) and niece ..." (OJ 3/3,
          p. ??, September 15, 1922).</p>

        <head>Correspondence with Heinrich and Others; Photographs</head>

        <p>Correspondence from Moriz to Heinrich Schenker survives as OJ 14/5 (1918-30: 41 items,
          including correspondence to Julia Schenker, 1912-14) and OC 54/31 and 32 (1925), A/284 and
          285 (1934). Some correspondence with Universal Edition exists as OC 52/466 and 467 (1924),
          and with Schenker's attorney Theodor Baumgarten, OC 52/703 (1925), regarding the dispute
          with UE. OJ 35/8 contains "financial transactions between Heinrich Schenker and Moriz
          Schenker, Anny Wollner and Drei Masken-Verlag, 1922-31."</p>

        <p>Two photographic portraits survive as OJ 72/18, Nos. 1 (Moriz in military uniform with
          wife, c. 1897) and 2 (Moriz alone, c. 1901).</p>
