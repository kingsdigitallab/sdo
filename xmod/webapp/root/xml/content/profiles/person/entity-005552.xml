      <head>Hans Richter</head>
      <div>

        <p>Austro-Hungarian conductor, closely associated with Wagner.</p>

        <p>Richter assisted Wagner in preparing a fair copy of the score of <title level="m">Die
            Meistersinger</title> at Wagner's home in 1866‒67, and returned later to assist with
          preparation of the <title level="m">Ring</title> cycle. He worked as conductor at the
          Munich Opera in 1868 and chief conductor at the National Theater in Pest 1871‒75. In 1875
          he became conductor of the Court Opera in Vienna. He was also conductor of the Vienna
          Philharmonic 1875‒98, and conductor to the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde 1880‒90. In 1876
          he conducted the first performance of the complete <title level="m">Ring</title> cycle,
          and conducted regularly at Bayreuth thereafter. He also conducted widely abroad. He also
          conducted the first performances of four of Bruckner's symphonies, two of Brahms's
          symphonies, several of Elgar's orchestral compositions, and many other works.</p>

        <p>There is no known correspondence or personal contact between Richter and Schenker.
          Schenker did, however, review concerts by Richter, and wrote about him as a conductor.</p>
