      <div>
        <p>Son of <ref cRef="entity-000466">Emil</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jenny
            Kornfeld</ref> (<hi rend="italic">née</hi> Schiff; later <ref cRef="entity-000771"
            >Jeanette Schenker</ref>); business man.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Erich Kornfeld was the elder son of <ref cRef="entity-000466">Emil</ref> and <ref
            cRef="entity-000771">Jenny Kornfeld</ref>. He had one sibling, <ref cRef="entity-000468"
            >Felix</ref>. After Jenny's departure from the family home (Dresdenerstraße 8, Aussig:
            <ref type="correspondence" cRef="CA-127">CA 127</ref>, September 20, 1910) in September
          1910, there was apparently no contact between Erich and his mother, under strict
          injunction from Emil. Tomáš Kornfeld stated in 1988:<cit>

            <q>This separation was total; all contacts with the family were broken off; [Jenny] was
              so to speak taboo for her husband Emil, and sons. Emil and Erich never again had any
              contact with her."</q>
          </cit></p>

        <p>In 1914 Erich joined a regiment (Schenker's diary, August 1, 1914), and Jenny made
          several appeals for information about his service in World War I, as a result of which she
          acquired his address (diary, October 7, 1914). Schenker's diary also records that Jeanette
          heard from her sister <ref cRef="entity-003244">Klara Hatschek</ref> (<hi rend="italic"
            >née</hi> Schiff) on May 9, 1932: "(long letter): all sorts of things – [...] concerning
          the Weils, Erich, and Felix."</p>

        <p>Erich married Marianne Öttl (1906‒) on March 21, 1925 in Ústí nad Labem, and the couple
          had two children: Peter, born March 30, 1932, and Charlotte, born July 19, 1944, both in
          Ústí nad Labem. A letter from the period 1940‒41 from Jenny (by this time Jeanette
          Schenker) to his brother Felix, quoted in a letter by grandson Tomáš Kornfeld (<ref
            type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-71-12a_2">OJ 71/12a, [2]</ref>, June 7, 1988) refers to
          Erich as having "long been of an age to understand a fateful passion [i.e. that which drew
          Jenny away from her family] and to come down from his lofty seat of judgment."</p>

        <p>As Jews, Erich and Felix were both arrested by the Gestapo on November 10, 1938 and taken
          to a concentration camp. Erich was released after six weeks on grounds that he was a
          "casualty and hero of the [first world] war," or as Felix recorded it a "front-line
          soldier" (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-14-7_1">OJ 14/7, [1]</ref>, August 23,
          1939). As Germans, Erich, Marianne and the children were driven out of Czechoslovakia
          after World War II, and settled at Holbeinstrasse 7, in Rosenheim-Kahltmühl, Erich's death
          date is unknown. Peter was a pharmacist.</p>

        <head>Correspondence</head>
        <p>No direct correspondence between Heinrich Schenker and Erich is known to have existed.
          Tomáš Kornfeld quoted (in <ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-71-12a_2">OJ 71/12a,
            [2]</ref>, June 7, 1988) from one postcard written by Erich to Emil while evidently on
          summer vacation: "Lots and lots of kisses, Papa ‒ greetings from H. Schenker – Greetings,
          Erich." No date is given for the postcard, and its survival since 1988 is unknown. The
          postcard does suggest that Heinrich knew Erich and Felix through holidaying with them
          between 1903 (when they were 8 and 4 respectively) and 1910</p>
