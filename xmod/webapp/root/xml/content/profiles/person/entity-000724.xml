        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Röntgen studied composition with Friedrich Lachner, harmony and counterpoint
          with Moritz Hauptmann and E. F. Richter, and piano with Louis Plaidy and Carl Reinecke. He
          lived in Amsterdam from 1877 to 1925, and was the Director of the Amsterdam Conservatory
          from 1912 to 1924. He was accompanist to the German baritone Julius Stockhausen, also to
          the Dutch baritone <ref cRef="entity-000592">Johannes Messchaert</ref> (whose
          interpretations Schenker greatly admired), and cellist Pablo Casals.</p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="bold">Röntgen and Schenker</hi>
        </p>
        <p>At Weinberger's request, Schenker asked Röntgen whether he would collaborate in
          practical editions of works of the classics for the newly founded <ref cRef="entity-002408">Universal Edition</ref> (NMI C 176-02: March 15, 1901), to
          which Röntgen replied affirmatively (OJ 13/27, [1]: March 18, 1901). Schenker
          thanked him for undertaking the work (NMI C 176-01: April 13, 1901), advising him to
          demand "a higher honorarium than usual" because his "intellectual property" is greater
          than that of "run-of-the-mill editors". Röntgen "was on friendly terms with
          Schenker, who for his part spoke well of his playing. The two had at any rate already been
          acquainted for several years" by 1901 (Federhofer, p.189).</p>

        <p>Later, however, Schenker spoke disparagingly about his editing. Of J. S. Bach's works,
          Röntgen edited for UE the Little Preludes and Fugues, the Two- and Three-part
          Inventions, French Suites, English Suites, Partitas, Italian Concerto, D-minor Concerto,
          <title level="m">Chromatic Fantasy &amp; Fugue</title>, and <title level="m">Well-tempered Clavier</title> (in 1907).</p>

        <head>Correspondence with Schenker</head>

        <p>Correspondence from Röntgen to Schenker survives as OJ 13/27 (1901-15: 9 items);
          that from Schenker to Röntgen survives in the Nederlands Muziek Instituut, Den
          Haag (1901-08: 3 letters). A photographic portrait of Röntgen, with autograph
          inscription by Schenker, dating from 1896, is preserved as OJ 72/12.</p>
