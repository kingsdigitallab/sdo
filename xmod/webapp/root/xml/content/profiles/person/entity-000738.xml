        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Alfred Rothberger was one of the four sons of the Viennese garment manufacturer Jakob
          Rothberger. After the death of his father in 1899, together with his brothers Moritz and
          Heinrich he took over the paternal firm. The "Rothberger Geschäftshäuser" [Rothberger
          houses of business] were located on the Stephansplatz at Nos. 1 and 9-11. Between 1917 and
          1926, Alfred and Hilda Rothberger lived at Vienna IV, Wohllebengasse 4 (close to the
          Stephansplatz), and before that at Vienna I, Augustinerstrasse 8.</p>

        <head>Rothberger and Schenker</head>
        <p>Clearly, Alfred Rothberger, like his brother Moritz (who was also a professional
          sculptor), was artistically gifted, too, and became a designer and engraver of medals and
          plaques (<hi rend="italic">Medailleur</hi>). A bronze medallion (<hi rend="italic"
            >Medaille</hi>) of Schenker survives as OJ 73/2 (photographs as OJ 72/14, No. 18), with
          the names "Heinrich Schenker" and "Alfred Rothberger" inscribed on the mold, with
          Schenker's profile on one side and a depiction of "tonal space" surrounded by laurel
          leaves and an inscription on the obverse. An announcement of the medallion was placed in
          the <title level="j">Neues Wiener Journal</title> for June 28, 1925: <cit>
            <q>(A Heinrich Schenker medal) The medal engraver Alfred Rothberger has made a portrait
              medal of the celebrated Viennese music theorist Heinrich Schenker, which, cast in
              bronze, will be issued in the form of a circular medallion and, greatly enlarged, as a
              plaque. On the reverse of the Schenker medal is rendered Schenker's beautifully
              expressed maxim: "Music is the living motion of tones in nature-given space." The
              finely executed bronze medal, which reproduces with great care the features of
              Schenker's profile, intellectually so animated, will surely be welcome to the numerous
              admirers and friends of the greatest music theorist of the present day.</q>
          </cit></p>

        <p>The medal was created between January and April 1925. Between March and May 1925 there
          was a lot of correspondence between Schenker, Rothberger and recipients of the medallion.
          A diary entry (OJ 3/7, p. 2775, January 20) suggests that Schenker divised the quoted
          "maxim" specially for the medallion. Initially, twenty-five copies were made of the
          smaller medal, while the larger plaque (<hi rend="italic">Plakette</hi>), of which one
          copy was supplied that Jeanette hung on her bedroom wall, was available only to order.
          Schenker distributed copies to his close pupils and friends. The medal was also available
          at music stores for 100,000 Kronen (OJ 3/7, p. 2823, May 27).</p>

        <p>Alfred Rothberger is also known to have created a plaque of the respected singing teacher
          Otto Iro (1890-1971) and a medallion bearing the portrait of Mahler.</p>

        <p>Of him on the day of his death, Schenker recorded in his diary (OJ 4/5, p. 3732):
          "Whenever he came or wrote, he forever conveyed joy, out of sheer joy toward us and in
          himself. He deserves heartfelt thanks."</p>

        <p>The Rothbergers' son <ref cRef="entity-000740">Karl</ref> took lessons with Schenker
          beginning April 4, 1934.</p>

        <head>Correspondence with Schenker</head>
        <p>No correspondence between Alfred Rothberger and Schenker is known to survive, but letters
          from his wife <ref cRef="entity-000739">Hilda Rothberger</ref> to Heinrich and Jeanette
          Schenker (enclosing letters from Karl Rothberger) survive as OJ 13/31 (1929-38: 30
          items).</p>
