        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Mitchell studied at the <ref cRef="entity-002437">Institute for Musical Art</ref>
          (1925‒29) and at <ref cRef="entity-005886">Columbia University</ref> (1926‒30), winning
          the Joseph H. Bearns Prize in composition. After two years in Vienna (1930‒32), he joined
          the faculty of Columbia, becoming associate professor in 1937, full professor in 1952, and
          serving as department chair 1962‒67, initiating the founding of the Columbia graduate
          student journal <title level="j">Current Musicology</title> (1965). He established an
          academic program in music theory and was the originator, with Douglas Moore, of the
          undergraduate Music Humanities course. He concurrently taught advanced analysis at <ref
            cRef="entity-002454">Mannes College</ref> 1957‒68, and lectured at various universities.
          In 1968 he became chair of the SUNY Binghamton music department's graduate program. An
          active member of music societies, he was president of the Society for Music in Liberal
          Arts Colleges (1954-55), one of the precursors of the College Music Society of which he
          was a founding member, as well as holding several offices in the American Musicological
          Society (including president, 1965-66). He was co-founder and joint editor with Felix
          Salzer of <ref cRef="entity-006981"><title level="j">The Music Forum</title></ref> from
          1967 to his death.</p>

        <head>Mitchell and Schenkerian Theory</head>
        <p>While in Vienna in 1930‒32, Mitchell studied with <ref cRef="entity-000951">Hans
            Weisse</ref>. His <title level="m">Elementary Harmony</title> (1939) was the first
          American textbook to draw explicitly on Schenker's ideas. He published a series of
          significant articles that employed Schenker's ideas, methods, and terminology, as did his
          lectures and his teaching of theory and analysis.</p>
