        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Noël Sullivan, son of "Frank" J. Sullivan and Alice Phelan, showed some talent in music
          at school and developed his abilities as an amateur singer. The family home was 2323 Hyde
          Street, <ref cRef="entity-002921">San Francisco</ref>, where Noël was later renowned for
          entertaining friends from the world of the arts. An heir to his wealthy uncle James D.
          Phelan, banker and politician, who died in 1930, he supported the arts in <ref
            cRef="entity-002921">San Francisco</ref>. In 1939 he moved to Hollow Hills Farm in
          Carmel Valley, where he continued to entertain friends, and participated in the Carmel
          Bach Festival in Carmel-by-Sea.</p>

        <head>Sullivan and Moriz Violin</head>
        <p> In ?October 1949, <ref cRef="entity-000913">Moriz Violin</ref> gave a "lecture concert"
          in Carmel, which featured <ref cRef="entity-000632">Heinrich Schenker</ref>'s arrangement
          of a harpsichord concerto by <ref cRef="entity-000025">C. P. E. Bach</ref> (probably that
          in A minor). This took place at the Carmel Bach Festival, and it seems likely that
          Sullivan was involved. In ?January 1950, <ref cRef="entity-000913">Violin</ref> received a
          letter from Sullivan ask him to inquire of <ref cRef="entity-000798">Arnold
            Schoenberg</ref> whether the latter was willing to serve as a judge in a composition
          competition (named for James D. Phelan) for American-born composers between the ages of 20
          and 40, for which <ref cRef="entity-007662">Roger Sessions</ref> was to be another of the
          judges. <ref cRef="entity-000913">Violin</ref> commented "Mr. Sullivan is a <hi
            rend="italic">very</hi> useful man." (<ref cRef="entity-000798">Schoenberg</ref>
          declined.)</p>
