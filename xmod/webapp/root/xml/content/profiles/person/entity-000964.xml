      <div>

        <p>Composer, conductor, pianist; pupil of Hans Weisse, and subsequently of Schenker 1931‒34. </p>

        <head>Career summary</head>
        <p>Willfort was the son of Friedrich Willfort (1879‒1956), engineer, and Bertha Willfort
            (<hi rend="italic">née</hi> Salzer) (1885‒1945), both close friends of the writer Fritz
          von Herzmanovsky-Orlando. He was born and educated in Vienna, studying in the conducting
          masterclass (Kapellmeisterstudium) at the Academy for Music and Performing Art under
          Oswald Kabasta 1932‒34 (his matriculation record survives). An advertisement in the <title
            level="j">Neue Freie Presse</title> for September 9, 1934 (a clipping of which is
          preserved as OC 44/48) gives Willfort's credentials: "Conductor / Schenker pupil [‒]
          tuition in: / theory, composition, rehearsal accompanying / M. Willfort, [??],
          Jacquingasse 37, Door C, Tel. B-50-1-96." Willfort does not appear in the Vienna street
          directory until 1931, when he is listed as "composer, [Vienna] III, Jacquingasse 37." From
          1932 to 1938 his address is given as Kölblgasse 2 (both addresses are very close to
          Schenker's in the <ref cRef="entity-002826">Keilgasse</ref>), then no listing after 1938. </p>

        <p>Between 1934 and 1938, Willfort conducted the Vienna Symphony Orchestra in concerts on
          Radio Wien (see Schenker's comment on one of these below). He had his first operatic
          engagement at the Nuremberg Opera House in 1935, followed by engagements at Allenstein and
          Königsberg in East Prussia. For two years, he served in the German army, then worked as
          first music director of the German Theatre in Lille, followed by two years at the Flemish
          Opera in Ghent. During these years, he conducted orchestral concerts in Lille, Ghent,
          Brussels, and Antwerp. (A photograph exists of him by invitation conducting an orchestra
          in Belgium in 1944.) Called back to military service in 1944 he spent several months in
          American captivity in France.</p>

        <p>After the war, he was engaged at the Vienna State Opera in 1947/48, then at the Linz
          Regional Theater as director of opera for three years. He again conducted the Vienna
          Symphony Orchestra in Vienna and Linz, and in the early 1950s was a regular broadcaster
          from Vienna and Salzburg. He worked also as a pianist, chamber musician, and teacher.</p>

        <p>From 1953 to 1956 he directed the Essen Opera House, working also with the city's Music
          Society. In October 1958 Willfort was appointed head of the music library at the City
          Library of Essen, in Germany. Simultaneously he was also editor of the periodical <title
            level="j">Essener Jugend</title> and active in music performance. On January 29, 1969,
          he married Ute Bourgeois. He retired from his position at the library in 1974, and died in
          1982.</p>

        <head>Willfort and Schenker</head>

        <p>Manfred Willfort was a student of <ref cRef="entity-000951">Hans Weisse</ref>, perhaps
          from as early as 1927 (cf. OJ 15/22, [9]), and member of a seminar conducted by Weisse
          prior to the latter's emigration to New York in September 1931. At the start of the
          1931/32 season, he became a member of Schenker's "<ref cRef="entity-002499">Friday
            seminar</ref>" with <ref cRef="entity-000473">Trude Kral</ref>, <ref
            cRef="entity-002498">Greta Kraus</ref>, and <ref cRef="entity-000754">Felix
          Salzer</ref>. He appears in Schenker's set of lesson notes for the seminar October 9, 1931
          to May 23, 1932 (OC 16/39‒42). He left the seminar in June 1934. </p>

        <p>A study of the third movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata in C# minor, Op. 27, No. 2
          ("Moonlight") signed by Willfort and dated "May 1934," with corrections by Schenker, and a
          cover inscribed in Jeanette Schenker's hand "Op. 27 II, Willfort, Elias, 18. X. 35,"
          survive in OJ 33/5. We know that graphs of the entire sonata were planned for inclusion in
          the second volume of <ref cRef="entity-001755"><title level="m">Fünf Urlinie-Tafeln/Five
              Analyses in Sketchform</title></ref>, intended for publication by the <ref
            cRef="entity-002454">David Mannes Music School</ref>, but never published (Salzer, p.
          19; OJ 5/89, [49], Aug 2, 1934). </p>

        <p>A booklet containing layered analytical sketches for the first movement of Beethoven's
          Piano Sonata in A-flat major, Op. 26 in Willfort's hand, dated June 1932, is preserved in
          the New York Public Library among the Felix Salzer Papers, as Box 28, File 62; and notes
          on the theme of the same movement, labeled "Theme (Willfort), vol. 2 <hi rend="italic"
            >Urlinie-Tafeln</hi>" are preserved as Box 27, File 16; and a sketch of the theme of
          Brahms's Paganini Variations, Op. 35, in Willfort's hand in Box 28, Files 63‒64. Graphs of
          both of these works were also intended for inclusion in the second volume of <title
            level="m">Fünf Urlinie-Tafeln/Five Analyses in Sketchform</title> (Salzer, pp. 18‒19). </p>

        <p>It was Willfort who in 1933 brought Schenker's attention to an article about Schenker by
            <ref cRef="entity-000131">Israel Citkowitz</ref> (OJ 5/18, 32, Dec 13, 1933), and made a
          German translation of it. In 1934, Oswald Jonas wrote to Schenker "Willfort is here
          [Berlin], as you know ‒ we are often together and diligently make music together" (OJ
          12/6, [32], June 11, 1934). </p>

        <p>Schenker listened to the radio concert on September 6, 1934, and judged it harshly in his
          diary (OJ 4/7, p. 3942): <cit>
            <q>at 9 o'clock Willfort: an orchestra of modest ability, he conducts ineffectually, his
              intentions are physically too weakly conveyed and he has no power over the orchestra.
              No trace of animal feeling, of warmth, all delight in playing is absent. Worst of all
              the contradiction between that and the lofty aspirations: Brahms' "Tragic" Overture,
              Brahms' Fourth Symphony, Beethoven "Coriolan" Overture!! I fear that Kabasta is taken
              in by the "Schenker pupil"! ‒ I give up in the second movement.</q>

        <head>Correspondence</head>
        <p>Thirteen items of correspondence survive from Willfort to Schenker: twelve letters (OJ
          15/22, 1931‒35; OC 44/42, 1934) and one note (OC 44/3, 1933). None are known to survive
          from Schenker to Willfort. </p>
