        <p>Composer, conductor, pianist; pupil of Hans Weisse, and subsequently of Schenker 1931‒34. </p>

        <head>Career summary</head>
        <p>An advertisement in the <title level="j">Neue Freie Presse</title> for September 9, 1934
          (a clipping of which is preserved as OC 44/48) gives Willfort's credentials:
          "Kapellmeister / Schenker pupil [‒] tuition in: / theory, composition, repetiteuring / M.
          Willfort, [??], Jacquingasse 37, Door C, Tel. B-50-1-96." Willfort does not appear in the
          Vienna street directory until 1931, when he is listed as "composer, [Vienna] III,
          Jacquingasse 37." From 1932 to 1938 his address is given as Kölblgasse 2 (both addresses
          are very close to Schenker's in the <ref cRef="entity-002826">Keilgasse</ref>), then no
          listing after 1938. </p>

        <p>On September 6, 1934, Willfort conducted a concert on Radio Wien (OC 44/42 ‒ see
          Schenker's comment below). (A photograph exists of him by invitation conducting an
          orchestra in Belgium in 1944.) He was also a pianist, chamber musician, and teacher. </p>
      </div>

        <head>Willfort and Schenker</head>

        <p>Manfred Willfort was a student of <ref cRef="entity-000951">Hans Weisse</ref>, perhaps
          from as early as 1927 (cf. OJ 15/22, [9]), and member of a seminar conducted by Weisse
          prior to the latter's emigration to New York in September 1931. At the start of the
          1931/32 season, he became a member of Schenker's "<ref cRef="entity-002499">Friday
            seminar</ref>" with <ref cRef="entity-000473">Trude Kral</ref>, <ref
            cRef="entity-002498">Greta Kraus</ref>, and <ref cRef="entity-000754">Felix
          Salzer</ref>. He appears in Schenker's set of lesson notes for the seminar October 9, 1931
          to May 23, 1932 (OC 16/39‒42). He left the seminar in June 1934. </p>

        <p>A study of the third movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata in C# minor, Op. 27, No. 2
          ("Moonlight") signed by Willfort and dated "May 1934," with corrections by Schenker, and a
          cover inscribed in Jeanette Schenker's hand "Op. 27 II, Willfort, Elias, 18. X. 35,"
          survive in OJ 33/5. We know that graphs of the entire sonata were planned for inclusion in
          the second volume of <ref cRef="entity-001755"><title level="m">Fünf Urlinie-Tafeln/Five
              Analyses in Sketchform</title></ref>, intended for publication by the <ref
            cRef="entity-002454">David Mannes Music School</ref>, but never published (Salzer, p.
          19; OJ 5/89, [49], Aug 2, 1934). </p>

        <p>A booklet containing layered analytical sketches for the first movement of Beethoven's
          Piano Sonata in A-flat major, Op. 26 in Willfort's hand, dated June 1932, is preserved in
          the New York Public Library among the Felix Salzer Papers, as Box 28, File 62; and notes
          on the theme of the same movement, labeled "Theme (Willfort), vol. 2 <hi rend="italic"
            >Urlinie-Tafeln</hi>" are preserved as Box 27, File 16; and a sketch of the theme of
          Brahms's Paganini Variations, Op. 35, in Willfort's hand in Box 28, Files 63‒64. Graphs of
          both of these works were also intended for inclusion in the second volume of <title
            level="m">Fünf Urlinie-Tafeln/Five Analyses in Sketchform</title> (Salzer, pp. 18‒19). </p>

        <p>It was Willfort who in 1933 brought Schenker's attention to an article about Schenker by
            <ref cRef="entity-000131">Israel Citkowitz</ref> (OJ 5/18, 32, Dec 13, 1933), and made a
          German translation of it. In 1934, Oswald Jonas wrote to Schenker "Willfort is here
          [Berlin], as you know ‒ we are often together and diligently make music together" (OJ
          12/6, [32], June 11, 1934). </p>

        <p>Schenker listened to the radio concert on September 6, 1934, and judged it harshly in his
          diary (OJ 4/7, p. 3942): <cit>
            <q>at 9 o'clock Willfort: an orchestra of modest ability, he conducts ineffectually, his
              intentions are physically too weakly conveyed and he has no power over the orchestra.
              No trace of animal feeling, of warmth, all delight in playing is absent. Worst of all
              the contradiction between that and the lofty aspirations: Brahms' "Tragic" Overture,
              Brahms' Fourth Symphony, Beethoven "Coriolan" Overture!! I fear that Kabasta is taken
              in by the "Schenker pupil"! ‒ I give up in the second movement.</q>

        <head>Correspondence</head>
        <p>Thirteen items of correspondence survive from Willfort to Schenker: twelve letters (OJ
          15/22, 1931‒35; OC 44/42, 1934) and one note (OC 44/3, 1933). None are known to survive
          from Schenker to Willfort. </p>
