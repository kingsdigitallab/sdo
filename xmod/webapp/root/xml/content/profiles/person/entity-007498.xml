        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Alfred Victor Frankenstein was born in Chicago and graduated from the University of
          Chicago (PhB) in 1932. He played clarinet in the Civic Orchestra of Chicago 1923‒30, then
          worked as assistant music critic of the <title level="j">Chicago American</title> 1931‒34,
          while lecturing in the history of music at the University 1932‒34. He was music and art
          critic of the <title level="j">San Francisco Chronicle</title> 1934‒65 and program
          annotator for the San Francisco Symphony from 1935. In the 1960s and 1970s he was a
          professor of Art History at Mills College, California, and in the 1970s also at the
          University of California, Berkeley. In the 1960s, he wrote five books on 18th- and
          19th-century American art, and a guide to symphonic music.</p>

        <p><ref cRef="entity-000798">Arnold Schoenberg</ref> provided <ref cRef="entity-000913"
            >Moriz Violin</ref> (who had emigrated to the USA and settled in San Francisco in 1939)
          with letters of introduction to several people including Frankenstein, who is mentioned in
          three of Violin's letters to Schoenberg (LC ASC 27/45, [12], [15], [32]). Frankenstein
          proved the most helpful, though it is unclear whether he assisted him in procuring a
          position, and also whether the two men ever met. Communication between Frankenstein and
          Moriz Violin clearly took place, though no correspondence is known to survive. One undated
          letter from Frankenstein to <ref cRef="entity-000412">Oswald Jonas</ref> is preserved as
          OJ 36/125, [1].</p>
