      <head>Toni [Tony] Colbert </head>

      <div>
        <p>Piano pupil of Schenker's between 1906 and
          1916, and wife of newspaper proprietor <ref cRef="colbert_carl">Carl Colbert</ref>.</p> 
          
          <p>Toni
          Colbert first asked Schenker for lessons on December 5, 1906 (OJ 1/5, p. 28), and may have
          studied with him first in the 1906/07 season (OJ 1/6, p. 44). She may well have taken
          further lessons in the 1907/08, 1908/09, 1909/10, and 1910/11 seasons (though there are no
          lessonbooks to substantiate this surmise), for on May 30, 1911 Schenker declined to give
          her further lessons, recording in his diary that he had intended to prepare a special
          program for her in view of her "advancing age," but that although her letters spoke
          glowingly of her love of music she was obsessed with money. In September 1912 he turned
          her down again, but after further correspondence he accepted her on strict stated
          conditions, and she recommenced lessons on October 4, 1912, continuing through to mid-June
          1916 (lessonbooks 1912/13, 1913/14, 1914/15, 1915/16), taking only one lesson per week--an
          arrangement of which Schenker sharply disapproved and which was probably the primary cause
          of the previous difficulties. She appears to have been somewhat unreliable in attendance
          and dilatory in payment of fees.</p>
        
        <p>There are nine letters from Toni and Carl Colbert to Schenker (OJ 9/30: 1912-20)</p>
