        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Elkus graduated from the University of California, Berkeley (AB, MLitt 1907), and studied
          piano in Europe with <ref cRef="entity-005307">Harold Bauer</ref> and Josef Lhévinne. He
          studied composition in San Francisco with Oscar Weil, and in Vienna and Berlin with <ref
            cRef="entity-000265">Robert Fuchs</ref>, <ref cRef="entity-003684">George Schumann</ref>
          and <ref cRef="entity-000763">Franz Schalk</ref>. He subsequently became head of the Music
          Theory Department at the San Francisco Conservatory (1923‒25, 1930‒34), and also taught at
          Mills College (1929‒44). He was appointed Professor of Music at University of California,
          Berkeley in 1935, chairman from 1937, retiring in 1951. From 1951 to 1957 he was Director
          of the San Francisco Conservatory. He was also active in music teacher organizations.</p>

        <head>Elkus and Moriz Violin</head>
        <p><ref cRef="entity-000798">Arnold Schoenberg</ref> provided <ref cRef="entity-000913"
            >Moriz Violin</ref> (who had emigrated to the USA and settled in San Francisco in 1939)
          with letters of introduction to several people including Elkus. He is mentioned in letters
          between Schoenberg and Violin in the years 1939 to 1941 (LC ASC 7/50, [3] and [6], LC ASC
          27/45, [12], [15], [17], [29]). Schoenberg comments at one point "I am told that Elkus,
          who is a Jew, has very influential contacts in wealthy circles, and could perhaps help you
          considerably" (LC ASC 7/50, [6], July 21, 1939). <ref cRef="entity-007498">Alfred V.
            Frankenstein</ref> also provided Violin with a letter to Elkus. Violin later wrote
          "Elkus has responded. I was with him this morning. He has known of me for thirty years and
          was at one time friendly with close friends of mine in Vienna and wanted to have lessons
          with Schenker." (LC ASC 27/45, [15], August 24, 1939). Violin later remarked: "When Elkus
          sees me at a concert, he leaves the most important people behind and descends on me with
          how glad he is to meet me!" (LC ASC 27/45, [17], January 26, 1940). And when he was later
          interviewed, Violin outlined some of his ideas drawing on an article by Elkus (LC ASC
          27/45, [29], July 20, 1941).</p>
