        <head>Career Summary</head>

        <p>Goldmark studied violin at the Vienna Conservatory in the 1840s, and embarked upon a
          career in Vienna as a professional violinist working in theater orchestras. Largely
          self-taught, he began to compose c. 1860, and became an honorary member of the Vienna
          Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in 1866. His compositions include six operas, the best known
          of which was his first, <title level="m">Die Konigin von Saba</title> (<title level="m"
            >The Queen of Sheba</title>) (1875), and also orchestral, choral, and chamber works, and
          solo songs. He wrote a book of memoirs that was published in 1922.</p>

        <head>Goldmark and Schenker</head>

        <p>Schenker reviewed his opera <title level="m">Das Heimchen am Herd</title> (<title
            level="m">The Cricket on the Hearth</title> ‒ Charles Dickens) in 1896. Schenker's diary
          for February 8, 1897 (Series A, p. 1) records a "visits to Goldmark and Brüll" from whom
          he received "thoroughly favorable judgement of my compositions." Schenker and Goldmark
          then went to the Café Landmann and talked further. On March 8, 1907, Schenker asked Cotta
          to send a complimentary copy of his <ref cRef="entity-001724"><title level="m"
              >Harmonielehre</title></ref> to Goldmark.</p>

        <p>Goldmark is mentioned several times in Schenker's subsequent diaries, including an
          extended tribute at his death on January 2, 1915 that begins: "Karl Goldmark is dead! What
          was most touching in him was a striving that was never without a certain solemnity and
          ceremoniousness. Even more moving was his modesty, which expressed itself in a
          consciousness that he was unable to achieve the ideal of masterhood." and ends: "There
          have been many musicians who were compelled to advance themselves autodidactically, but
          rarely was it granted to anyone to complete their development so thoroughly and
          meticulously." (diary, January 3, 1915). After 1915, there are several further references
          to him, including an extensive discussion with Alfred Rothberger on October 3, 1926.</p>

        <p>— No correspondence between the two men is known to survive.</p>
