      <head>Paul Berl</head>
      <div>

        <p>Austrian or Czech pianist, accompanist, conductor, and teacher, who contributed an

        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>According to a newspaper article about his daughter, Paul Berl was Czech and Jewish; but
          the New York census for 1940 records his country of birth as Austria, and his <title
            level="j">New York Times</title> obituary described his as a "native of Vienna." He
          studied musicology at the University of Vienna, receiving his doctorate in 1931 with a
          dissertation entitled "<title level="u">Die Opern Giuseppe Verdis in ihrer
            Instrumentation.</title>" It is thought that he also studied with <ref
            cRef="entity-000412">Oswald Jonas</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000754">Felix Salzer</ref>
          in Vienna, but whether privately or at the <ref cRef="entity-002451">Neues Wiener
            Konservatorium</ref> is unclear. His obituary states that he was a "graduate of the <ref
            cRef="entity-002591">Music Academy</ref>;" if so, then his study there could not have
          been with either Jonas or Salzer. He also had a conductorship at an opera house in
          Germany.</p>

        <p>Berl and his wife Maria (Kloss) moved to the USA from Austria in 1938, settling in New
          York. In 1943 they had a daughter, Christine, who became a composer, dancer, and pianist.
          At the <ref cRef="entity-002454">Mannes Music School</ref>, where he taught for
          twenty-eight years, Berl became head of opera studies and conducted opera and orchestra
          performances (notably, rarely performed operas), taught conducting and accompanying, and
          coached singers. Among the vocalists whom he coached was Mannes student Frederica von
          Stade. For twenty-two years he served as the regular American accompanist for Victoria de
          los Angeles, with whom he made several recordings. He also accompanied Erna Berger,
          Mattiwalda Dobbs and many other singers in recitals. At the time of his death, he was
          living at 250 West 85th Street in New York.</p>

            level="j">Der Dreiklang</title>, Heft 2 (May 1937).</p> 
        <p>There is no known surviving
          correspondence between him and Schenker, Jonas, or Moriz Violin.</p>
