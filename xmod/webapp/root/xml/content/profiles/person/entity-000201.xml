      <head>Angelika [Angelica; Angi] (Rifka) Elias</head>
      <p>Turkish-born Austrian-Jewish pianist and music teacher. Schenker's longest-term pupil and
        one of his most devoted patrons.</p>

      <div>
        <head>Life</head>
        <p>Angi Elias (the diminutive form of name seems to have been almost universally used) was
          Jewish and of Turkish citizenship, born in Vienna. Her parents were Heinrich Menachem
          Elias (c.1841‒1901) and <ref cRef="entity-000202">Rachel</ref> (<hi rend="italic">née</hi>
          Russo) (1853‒1934). Angi had five older sisters, Valerie Grassia, Ida, Melanie Miriam,
          Sofie Anna, and Elsa Ester (all later married), and two younger brothers, <ref
            cRef="entity-000203">Manolo Menachem</ref> and Jacques, all born in either Vienna or
          Bucharest.</p>

        <p>Her father Heinrich and his two brothers, Abraham Menachem (1839‒1908) and Jacques
          Menachem (1844‒1923) were proprietors of the firm A. H. Elias Brothers, wholesale
          merchants of Turkish goods, located, at the time of Angi's birth, at Vienna I, Hafnersteig
          5. By 1890 the firm had moved to Augustengasse 4 (both addresses close to the Josefs-Kai
          and Danube canal). The firm steadily prospered, becoming by 1910 a registered "bank and
          commissioning business." It continued through World War I under Jacques as the sole
          propietor, but seems to have collapsed in 1920.</p>

        <p>In 1921 Jacques moved to the nearby Gölsdorfgasse 4, which is the address given in the
          earliest letters of Angi to Heinrich Schenker. Angi continued to live at that address, and
          after Jacques' death became the resident of record. Her mother's death in August 1934 is
          referred to in <ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-10-18_8">OJ 10/18, [8]</ref> and
          Schenker's diary. In 1936 she moved to Vienna XIII, Nikolausgasse 1, and remained there
          until 1941 after which she disappears from the Vienna street directory. She perished in
          the Ravensbrück concentration camp in 1944. (Of her sisters, Melanie died in the camp in
          Riga, and Sofie committed suicide in Vienna in 1938.)</p>

        <p>First evidence of Elias giving lessons herself occurs early in 1918, the lessons in
          question being in music theory (diary, February 28, March 2, 9, 16). Schenker probably
          steered other pupils in her direction, and certainly advised her on what fees to charge.
          Her close friend, <ref cRef="entity-000416">Marianne Kahn</ref>, with whom she
          occasionally took holidays, and after Schenker's death visited his grave every June 19,
          was also a piano teacher.</p>

      <div>
        <head>Elias and Schenker</head>
        <p>Elias's first lesson with Schenker occurred in late January 1905 (Schenker's diary for
          January 28, 1925 records that Elias brings a present "in remembrance of her first lesson
          twenty years ago") ‒ lessonbooks do not exist prior to 1912. She continued having lessons
          with him to his death in 1935, taking the full package of three lessons a week, and a
          comprehensive range of instruction in piano, theory, analysis, and source studies.
          Schenker's table of her intended lessons for 1934/35 shows her still having three lessons
          per week (Tuesday morning, Thursday afternoon, Friday morning) ‒ more than any of his
          other pupils that year (Oster Collection A/262, A/259 and A/264). After Schenker's death
          in January 1935, Elias does not seem to have taken lessons at the Schenker Institute which
          operated in the Neues Wiener Konservatorium between 1935 and 1938.</p>
