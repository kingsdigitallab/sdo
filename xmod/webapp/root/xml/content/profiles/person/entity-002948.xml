      <div>
        <p>Schillings studied law, philosophy, literature, and art history at the University of
          Munich before becoming associated with the circle around Richard Strauss in Munich. He
          worked as assistant conductor at Bayreuth from 1892, and was appointed royal professor of
          music at the University of Munich in 1903. After working at the Royal Opera House in
          Stuttgart from 1908 to 1918, he became Intendant at the Prussian State Opera in Berlin, a
          post he held until 1925, and in which he was involved in productions of works by Pfitzner,
          Schreker, Strauss, Busoni and others.</p>

        <p>Schillings composed four operas, also works for orchestra, for chorus, solo songs with
          piano and with orchestra, and a small amount of chamber music.</p>

        <p>Schillings is mentioned by Dahms in a letter to Schenker of November 2, 1915 (OJ 10/1,
          [13]).</p>
