      <head>Fräulein Schaab</head>
      <div>
        <p>Pupil of Schenker's for four seasons, 1918/19 to 1921/22, studying the solo piano
          repertory and also counterpoint in up to at least three voices.</p>
        <p>Schaab is first mentioned in Schenker's diary on September 3, 1918 inquiring about
          tuition, and was accepted by Schenker for the season beginning October 1 that year, taking
          in some seasons two lessons a week, in others one, depending on her finances – she had
          pupils of her own, with the fees from whom she funded her studies with Schenker. On April
          7, 1919 she asked to reduce to only two lessons a month, which Schenker refused. On May
          16, 1922 she announced her engagement to be married, and on June 19 she left Schenker.</p>
