        <p>German industrialist, patron of the arts.</p>

        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p> Max Temming was the proprietor of the firm Peter Temming, a cotton bleachery, flax
          processing and papermaking plant founded in 1911 in Glückstadt near Hamburg. His private
          address in 1925 was Hamburg 37, Parkallee 65. Temming was also active as a patron of the
          arts in Hamburg, and in the summer of 1923 founded an ensemble modeled on Schoenberg's
          Verein für musikalische Privataufführungen (Society for Private Musical Performances,
          which had been founded in Vienna in 1918 and ceased activity in 1921). A letter from <ref
            cRef="entity-000798">Schoenberg</ref> to Temming about the ensemble, which Schoenberg
          refers to as the "Hamburg project," and for which Josef Rufer was his contact, dates from
          June 28, 1923. </p>

        <head>Temming, Schenker, and Moriz Violin</head>
        <p>Moriz Violin, who was living in Hamburg at the time, became acquainted with Temming in
          1923, and approached him on July 13 of that year with a view to his supporting the
          distribution of Schenker's <title level="j">Der Tonwille</title>. Temming is mentioned in
          several of Violin's letters to Schenker (including OC 52/644, April 21, 1925). In December
          1923, a plan was mooted in which Schenker would go to Hamburg and give a recital in
          Temming's house before invited musicians and critics, possibly linked to <ref
            cRef="entity-000268">Furtwängler</ref>'s presence (OJ 3/6, pp. 2610, 2614). Temming
          caused <ref cRef="entity-002456">Albert J. Gutmann</ref> in December 1924 to send one copy
          of each of seven issues of <title level="j">Der Tonwille</title> to music-historical
          seminars of the universities of Berlin, Bonn, Breslau, Freiburg, Leipzig, Königsberg,
          Halle, Göttingen, Munich, and Frankfurt at a cost of 355 Marks (OC 52/619), and later
          purchased copies of issues 7, 8/9, and 10 (OC 52/643). </p>

      <div>
        <head>Correspondence with Schenker</head>
        <p>One letter from Temming to Schenker is known to survive (OC 52/621: February 17, 1925),
          and two relevant invoices also survive (OC 52/619 and 643: December 3, 1924, March 15,
          1925). Schenker frequently spelt his name "Thömming," "Töning," and other variants. </p>
