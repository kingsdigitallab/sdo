        <head>Career summary</head>
        <p>Born in Drohobycz, near <ref cRef="entity-002401">Lemberg</ref>, he is said to have
          taught his younger sister, <ref cRef="entity-000878">Paula</ref>, the basics of piano
          playing, in addition to which she may have studied at the Lemberg Conservatory. He took
          his sister when she was eight years old to Vienna, where she studied first with Robert
          Fischof. In 1902–1904, he – presumably Paula, too – was living at Vienna IX,
          Porzellangasse 54, his profession stated in the street directory as “pianist.” However, he
          apparently suffered from bad eyesight and had to relinquish hopes of a performance
          career.</p>

        <p>Where he was immediately after 1904 is unknown. <ref cRef="entity-000878">Paula</ref> was
          appointed to the piano faculty of the <ref cRef="entity-002401">Lemberg</ref> Conservatory
          as the head of the advanced piano class. All that is known of Heinrich thereafter is an
          entry in the <title level="j">Karlsbader Kurliste</title> (Karlsbad [=Karlovy Vary, in
          Bohemia] Court List) for July 22, 1909: <cit>
            <q>Name and status: Mr. Heinrich Szalit, piano teacher, with wife Adele and son Emil |
              Usual residence: Drohobycz | Residence here: Amor, Morgenzeile.</q>
          </cit>
        </p>

      <div>
        <head>Heinrich Szalit and Schenker</head>
        <p>In an early but undated calling card, <ref cRef="entity-000878">Paula</ref> sent “best
          wishes from Heinrich,” which indicates that the two men were acquainted, perhaps from the
          time <ref cRef="entity-000878">Paula</ref> studied with Schenker in 1896 and 1897.
          Schenker’s diary for April 11, 1915 records: <cit>
            <q>Mr. Heinrich Schalit arrives at my place to inquire if I might perhaps have some
              access to <ref cRef="entity-000743">Rothschild</ref> or Springer, or someone like
              that, who could come with money to the aid of his sister, who was tragically injured
              in an accident. He takes the opportunity to inform me that Mr. Kux, Mrs. Popper, and
                <ref cRef="entity-000199">Mrs. Eissler</ref> together provide 110 Kronen per
              month.</q>
          </cit>
        </p>

        <p>No correspondence between the two men is known to survive.</p>
