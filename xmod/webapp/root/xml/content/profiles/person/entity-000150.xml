        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>D'Albert studied at the New Music School, London (1874-). He was rated highly as a
          pianist by Rubinstein, knew Liszt, Richter, Brahms (a member of whose circle he was), and
          Hanslick, and established an international career as a virtuoso concert pianist. His
          career as a composer began around 1893; by 1908, he had written eight operas, all
          performed, and a number of orchestral works, piano pieces, chamber works, and Lieder. By
          his death, he had written 20 operas, musical comedies, music dramas, etc.</p>

        <head>D'Albert and Schenker</head>
        <p>D'Albert and Schenker corresponded from at least 1894; Schenker wrote an article on
          d'Albert in <title level="j">Die Zukunft</title> (October 6, 1894), pp.33-36 (OJ 20/2;
          Federhofer (1990), pp.115-21); and among Schenker's possessions is a photographic portrait
          of d'Albert inscribed: "To Dr. Heinrich Schenker, a true friend, as a memento of Eugen
          d'Albert. Frankfurt/a/M, October 6, 1998." (OJ 72/1). See also Federhofer (1985), pp.
          55-68.</p>
        <p>D'Albert had already written a letter of recommendation for Schenker's <title level="m">Harmonielehre</title> to Brockhaus on November 7, 1905, and it was his intervention with
          Cotta (reply from Cotta to d'Albert, OJ 9/31, [2], November 14, 1905) that persuaded that
          company to adopt the book, having initially rejected it. Schenker began to distance
          himself from d'Albert around 1907, becoming disillusioned with d'Albert's music, as in
          the entry "<title level="m">Verschenkte Frau</title> by d'Albert: inexcusably banal;
          instructive: in the midst of the meaninglessness, the final scene of Act II also
          underlined with corresponding musical tedium." (lessonbook, OC 3/1, February 8, 1912).
          After 1914 the two men drifted out of touch without a formal break.</p>

        <head>Correspondence with Schenker</head>
        <p>Correspondence between d'Albert and Schenker survives as OJ 9/6 (1984-1914: 73 items),
          and one item from d'Albert to Moriz Violin as 70/6 (1904).</p>
