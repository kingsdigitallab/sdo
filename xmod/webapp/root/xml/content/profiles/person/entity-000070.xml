        <head>Career Summary</head>

        <p>Beyschlag worked as a conductor in Trier and Cologne 1868–80, and as concert director in
          Mainz and Frankfurt. He then moved to Belfast as conductor of the Philharmonic Society
          there, followed briefly by work as Charles Hallé’s assistant in Manchester, then in 1895
          moved to Leeds in charge of the subscription concerts of its Philharmonic Society. In 1902
          he moved to Berlin. In 1908 he published his major book, <title level="m">Die Ornamentik
            der Musik</title> (Leipzig: Breitkopf &amp; Härtel), to which <ref cRef="entity-000750"
            >Ernst Rudorff</ref> wrote the Preface.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Beyschlag and Schenker</head>
        <p>Schenker published his <ref cRef="entity-001721"><title level="m">Beitrag zur
              Ornamentik</title></ref> in 1903, enlarging it in 1908. It concerned primarily the
          rendering of ornamentation in the keyboard works of <ref cRef="entity-000025">C. P. E.
            Bach</ref>, but included a considerable amount of material on that of <ref
            cRef="entity-000344">Haydn</ref>, <ref cRef="entity-000612">Mozart</ref>, and <ref
            cRef="entity-000055">Beethoven</ref>. He became aware of Beyschlag’s work through his
          friend <ref cRef="entity-000750">Ernst Rudorff</ref>, who arranged for a copy to be sent
          to him in September 1908, just a few weeks after the 1908 edition of his <title level="m"
            >Beitrag</title> had been released. In reaction, he described it as “all-encompassing”
          and “encyclopedic,” but at first sight took issue with some of Beyschlag’s interpretations
            (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-5-35_3">OJ 5/35, [3]</ref>, September 28, 1908).
          Schenker understandably saw Beyschlag’s work as a rival to his own, but nevertheless did
          refer to it in his lessons.</p>
