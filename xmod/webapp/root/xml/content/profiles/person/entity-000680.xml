      <head>Ernst Praetorius [Preetorius]</head>
      <div>

        <p>German musicologist and music director.</p>

        <div>
          <head>Career Summar</head>
          <p>Praetorius studied music composition as a child, then music history and systematic
            music with Carl Stumpf at the University of Berlin 1899‒1905 with a dissertation on the
            mensural theory of Gafurius. He was director of the Heyer Music-Historical Museum
            1906‒09, then worked as repetiteur and music director at the Cologne Opera 1909‒12 and
            subsequently as music director at theaters and opera houses in Bochum, Leipzig, Breslau,
            Lübeck, Berlin, and Weimar. He was attacked in the national socialist press for his
            involvement in contemporary opera (Krenek, Hindemith), and under that pressure was
            removed from his Weimar position in 1933, and went into exile in Turkey in 1935.</p>

          <head>Praetorius and Schenker</head>
          <p>This may be the "Preetorius" who wrote an article for <title level="j">Der Rotarier für
              Deutschland und Österreich</title> in January 1931, to which <ref cRef="entity-000643"
              >Reinhard Oppel</ref> drew Schenker's attention as favorable toward Schenker, and a
            copy of which Schenker obtained. On February 9 "Preetorius" gave a lecture, attended by
            Schenker, Jeanette, and <ref cRef="entity-000951">Hans Weisse</ref>, who identifed
            deficiencies, while Schenker was disappointed that it failed to consider music. Schenker
            subsequently arranged for a copy of <ref cRef="entity-001752"><title level="j"
                >Meisterwerk</title> III</ref> to be sent to him, and followed that with a letter on
            February 12/13 (which appears to survive as OJ 5/30, [1]), believing that his theory of
            cohesiveness (<hi rend="italic">Zusammenhang</hi>), as set out in the article <title
              level="a">Rameau oder Beethoven?</title> in <ref cRef="entity-001752"><title level="j"
                >Meisterwerk</title> III</ref> on pp. 20‒21 (Eng. transl, pp. 7‒8) addressed the
            question raised in Preetorius's article. (See diary, January 24, February 8, 9, 11, 12,
            13, 14, 17, 26, March 8, 1931.)</p>
