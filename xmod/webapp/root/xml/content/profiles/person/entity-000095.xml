      <head>Jan Willem Franz Brandts-Buys</head>
      <div>

        <p>Dutch composer and editor.</p>

        <p>Brandts-Buys studied at the Raff Conservatory in Frankfurt, and in 1893 settled in
          Vienna, where after 1901 he worked for <ref cRef="entity-002408">Universal Edition</ref>
          preparing piano arrangements. As a composer, he was influenced by Brahms and Grieg. He
          wrote eight operas, three piano concertos, and orchestral and chamber works.</p>

      <div>
        <head>Brandts-Buys and Universal Edition</head>
        <p>When Universal Edition was founded in 1901, Brandts-Buys immediately became its chief
          arranger of the central classical repertory of opera, orchestral, concerto, and chamber
          works for piano, both two-hands and four-hands. Thus he arranged the later Mozart,
          Beethoven and Schubert symphonies for four hands, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, and Weber
          overtures for two and four hands, all the Beethoven concertos and the Mendelssohn violin
          concerto and all the Beethoven string quartets for four hands, and <title level="m">Don
            Giovanni</title>, <title level="m">Zauberflöte</title>, <title level="m">Figaro</title>,
            <title level="m">Fidelio</title>, and <title level="m">Der Freischütz</title> for two
          hands, and many other works. He must thus have supplied Universal Edition with one of its
          most lucrative product ranges.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Brandts-Buys and Schenker</head>
        <p>In 1905, Schenker made piano four-hands arrangements of a selection of <ref
            cRef="entity-001722">Handel organ concertos</ref> (UE 936). A second volume by him (UE
          937) was scheduled and advertized, but Schenker refused to hand over the materials because
          of a dispute over the size of his honorarium. Universal Edition transferred the assignment
          to Brandts-Buys, whose volume was scheduled as vol. III (UE 1555) and published in
          1908.</p>
