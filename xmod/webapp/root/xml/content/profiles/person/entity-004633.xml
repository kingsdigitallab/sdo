          <head>Career Summary</head>

          <p>David Mannes studied violin in New York and Europe, including a period of study with
            Ysa”±e in Brussels (1903). From 1891 he was a violinist in the New York Symphony
            Orchestra, and from 1898 to 1912 its concertmaster. He also played chamber music,
            including recitals with pianist <ref cRef="entity-004634">Clara Damrosch</ref>, whom he
            married in 1898. In 1916 he founded the <ref cRef="entity-002454">David Mannes Music
              School</ref>, of which he and his wife were co-directors. He also conducted free
            public concerts at the Metropolitan Museum of New York from 1918 to 1947.</p>

          <p>In 1912 he founded the Music School Settlement for Colored People in New York City, and
            strove to bridge the divide between races in the belief that music was a universal
            language.</p>

          <head>The Schenker Circle and David Mannes</head>

          <p>David and Clara Mannes appointed Schenker's pupil <ref cRef="entity-000951">Hans
              Weisse</ref> in 1931 to teach music theory, and subsequently Weisse's and Schenker's
            pupil <ref cRef="entity-000754">Felix Salzer</ref>, and in so doing made the Mannes
            School of Music the principal vehicle for the transmission of Schenker's theories into
            the United States.</p>
