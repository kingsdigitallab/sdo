      <head>Hugo von Hofmannsthal</head>
      <div>

        <p>Austrian poet, playwright, and librettist.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Already at the age of 17, Hofmannsthal was producing lyric poetry of astonishing beauty
          and purity. Later, he turned to drama, and in 1920 with Max Reinhardt founded the Salzburg
          Festival.</p>

        <p>His association with Richard Strauss began in 1906 when Hofmannsthal suggested the latter
          might set his play <title level="m">Elektra</title> (1903) to music; the two men
          collaborated to create Strauss's opera of that name (1908). Thereafter, Hofmannsthal
          provided the libretti for Strauss's <title level="m">Der Rosenkavalier</title> (1910),
            <title level="m">Ariadne auf Naxos</title> (1912), <title level="m"
            >Josephslegende</title> (1914, ballet scenario), <title level="m">Der Bürger als
            Edelmann</title> (1917), <title level="m">Die Frau ohne Schatten</title> (1918), <title
            level="m">Die ägyptische Helena</title> (1927), and after his death <title level="m"
            >Arabella</title> (1932) and <title level="m">Die Liebe der Danae</title> (1940). Other
          composers who set Hofmannsthal's material include Zemlinsky, Nilson, Wagner-Régeny,
          Tcherepnin, and Varèse.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Hofmannsthal and Schenker</head>

        <p>There seems to have been no contact between the two men. Maximilian Harden mentioned the
          young Hofmannsthal's poetry to Schenker in 1896 (OJ 11/42, [27]), but we do know what
          Schenker replied.</p>

        <p>Schenker wrote extensive and generally favorable comments on Hofmannsthal's play <title
            level="m">Der Schwierige</title> in his diary for May 3, 1927. At Hofmannsthal's death
          he wrote in his diary for July 17, 1929: <cit>
            <q>The course of his life is distressing enough; even more so, of course, its end.
              Clearly a natural talent, as evidenced by the achievements of his youth, which could
              not have been achieved by lengthy contemplation. The obituaries show that his sorrows
              about the past have been interpreted as a denial of his poetic powers, which is most
              certainly not the case. Many of his works from the period after his breakdown have
              great force, verily on account of the pain that continues to resonate in them. Even
                <title level="m">Der Schwierige</title> cannot be praised too highly: precisely when
              set against the background of the time, it represents one of the best German
              comedies.</q>
