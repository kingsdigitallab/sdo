        <head>Wedge and Schenker</head>
        <p>As early as 1925, <ref cRef="warburg_gerald_f">Gerald F. Warburg</ref> reported that
          Wedge was "lecturing on the Urline" at the Institute of Musical Art (OJ 3/8, p. 2876). In
          a 1932 interview, Irvin Kolodin, who studied at the Institute while Wedge was teaching
          there, described him as "a pioneer in [Schenker's] work in America." <ref
            cRef="weisse_hans">Hans Weisse</ref> speaks of Wedge as: "the chief director of the
          Institute of Musical Art, who has been teaching according to your books for a long, long
          time, and is dying to meet me and learn more from me." (OJ 15/16, [82], October 15, 1931).
          Wedge is said to have produced a graph of the "Liebestod" from Wagner's <title level="m"
            >Tristan und Isolde</title> (Berry).</p>
        <p>There is no known correspondence between Wedge and Schenker.</p>
