        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Hans Barkan graduated from Stanford University (A.B.), then from Harvard Medical School
          in 1910 (M.D.), then studied ophthalmology for two years in Vienna, after which he
          returned to Harvard to teach pathology. He served in the Army Medical Corps during World
          War I. In 1925 he was appointed Professor of Ophthalmology and Head of Department at
          Stanford University Medical School in 1925, in which capacities he served until 1950,
          retiring from ophthalmology in 1954.</p>

        <p>Barkan was also an amateur violinist who played string quartets with members of the San
          Francisco Symphony, of which he was himself the Director. Barkan wrote the book
              <bibl><title level="m">Johannes Brahms and Theodor Billroth: Letters from a Musical
              Friendship</title> (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1957)</bibl>.</p>

        <p>In August 1939 <ref cRef="entity-000913">Moriz Violin</ref> was introducted to Hans
          Barkan by <ref cRef="entity-007501">Ada Clement</ref> of the <ref cRef="entity-007670">San
            Francisco Conservatory of Music</ref>. Violin reported to <ref cRef="entity-000798"
            >Arnold Schoenberg</ref>: "He will invite me next week and we will play quartets and
          quintets with musicians. He will then endeavor to enable me to play in public, etc., etc.
          [...] The one ray of sunshine in my protective sky, Dr. Barkan, put me in a hopeful mood
          because he is himself a supporting member of all the associations, knows all the rich
          people (e.g. Mrs. Coolidge), and because I can pretty well gain entr√©e to them for the
          first time." (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="LC-ASC-27-45_15">LC ASC 27/45,
