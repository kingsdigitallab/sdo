      <head>Fritz Mendl</head>

      <div>
        <p>Austrian leading industrialist, brother of Schenker’s pupil and patron <ref cRef="entity-000165">Mrs.
        Sofie Deutsch</ref>. Mendl bore the title of Kammerrat (Chamber Counsellor).</p>
        
        <p>Fritz and Heinrich Mendl, brothers, founded Ankerbrot (=Anchor Bread, its symbol being
          the anchor), the “Viennese Bread and Pastry Factory,” in the 10th
          district of Vienna in 1891; by 1914 this company had 1,300 employees, by 1920 2,000
          employees and 100 branches.</p>

        <head>Mendl and Schenker</head>
        
        <p>Schenker knew Fritz Mendl through his sister <ref cRef="entity-000165">Mrs. Sofie
          Deutsch</ref>, who was a pupil of Schenker's from c.1902
          to her death in 1917. Mendl is first mentioned in Schenker's diary on December
          21, 1906 (as "an excellent, clever person"). Schenker encountered
          him frequently when at Mrs. Deutsch's house, or when eating with her at the
          coffee house, and he was occasionally a guest at the house of Mendl and his wife.</p>

        <head>Correspondence with Schenker</head>
        
        <p>There is one letter from Mendl to Schenker, informing him of the provisions that Mrs.
          Deutsch had made for him in her will (OJ 12/52, January 12, 1917); Mendl is cited also in
          a disclaimer that Schenker subsequently signed (OJ 14/40[b], December 27, 1918). He is
          mentioned also in letters between Schenker and the attorneys Siegfried Türkel and
          Hugo Friedmann.</p>
