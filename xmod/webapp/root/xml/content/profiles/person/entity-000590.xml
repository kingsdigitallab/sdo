      <head>Fritz Mendl</head>

      <div>
        <p>Austrian leading industrialist, brother of <ref cRef="entity-000591">Heinrich
            Mendel</ref> and of Schenker’s pupil and patron <ref cRef="entity-000165">Mrs. Sofie
            Deutsch</ref>. Fritz Mendl bore the title of Kammerrat (Chamber Counsellor).</p>

        <p>Fritz and Heinrich Mendl were initially suppliers of alcoholic beverages,
          coffee, and tea, but in 1891 founded <ref cRef="entity-002420">Ankerbrot</ref> (=Anchor
          Bread, its symbol being the anchor), produced at the “Viennese Bread and Baked Goods
          Factory,” in the 10th district of Vienna; by 1914 this company had 1,300 employees, by
          1920 2,000 employees and 100 branches, was aryanized in 1938 but continues into the 21st
          century. </p>

        <head>Fritz Mendl and Schenker</head>

        <p>Schenker knew Fritz Mendl through his sister <ref cRef="entity-000165">Mrs. Sofie
            Deutsch</ref>, who was a pupil of Schenker's from c.1902 to her death in 1917. Mendl is
          first mentioned in Schenker's diary on December 21, 1906 (as "an excellent, clever
          person"). Schenker encountered him frequently when at Mrs. Deutsch's apartment, or when
          eating with her at the coffee-house, and he was occasionally a guest at the house of Mendl
          and his wife <ref cRef="entity-008060">Emilie "Milly" (<hi rend="italic">née</hi>
            Fried)</ref>.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Correspondence with Schenker</head>

        <p>There is one letter from Fritz Mendl to Schenker, informing him of the provisions that
          Mrs. Deutsch had made for him in her will (OJ 12/52, [1], January 12, 1917). Mendl is
          cited also in a disclaimer that Schenker subsequently signed (OJ 14/40[b], December 27,
          1918). He is mentioned also in letters between Schenker and the attorneys <ref
            cRef="entity-000902">Siegfried Türkel</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000257">Hugo
            Friedmann</ref>.</p>
