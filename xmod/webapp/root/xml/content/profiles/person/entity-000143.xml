      <head>Felix-Eberhard von Cube</head>

      <div>
        <p>German music theorist, teacher, and composer, pupil of Schenker's.</p>
        
        <p>Son of the architect and archaeologist Gustav von Cube, Felix-Eberhard grew up in Munich
          and studied music privately with <ref cRef="vrieslander_otto">Otto Vrieslander</ref>, a
          family friend who was for a time the private librarian to the playwright Carl Sternheim,
          Cube's maternal uncle. On Vrieslander's recommendation, Cube went to Vienna in late 1923
          to study with Schenker.</p>
        
        <p>The first lesson recorded in Schenker's lessonbooks (OC 3/3) is dated January 23, 1924,
          the last was June 4, 1926, with one postal lesson on January 27, 1927. Cube's instruction
          began with the final section of Schenker's <ref cRef="kontrapunkt_2"><title level="m">Kontrapunkt 2</title></ref>, continuing
          with a year of thoroughbass, fugal technique, analytical studies (mostly keyboard
          repertory), source studies, and work on Cube's own compositions.</p>
        
        <p>After a period of five years' teaching at the Rheinisches Musikseminar, a provincial
          conservatory in Duisburg in Germany's industrial area, he was recommended by Schenker to
          help <ref cRef="violin_moriz">Moriz Violin</ref> set up a Schenker-Institut in Hamburg in
          1931. The Institute had a shaky existence for about two years, closed down in 1934 and
          reopened after the War as the Heinrich-Schenker-Akademie, though with only modest success,
          continuing for another decade and a half.</p>
        
        <p>Unswervingly loyal to Schenker and his cause, Cube attempted to put his teacher's
          theories into a useful pedagogical form for German-speaking musicians, in a 
            <title level="m">Lehrbuch der musikalischen Kunstgesetze</title>, a typewritten treatise first
          conceived around 1934 but not finished until 1953 (and periodically augmented thereafter
          with further graphic analyses); an English version of this appeared in 1987 as 
            <title level="m">The Book of the Musical Artwork</title>. A second book, 
            <title level="m">Todeskampf oder Wiederauferstehung der Deutschen Musik</title> (Mortal Struggle, or the
          New Resurrection of German Music), is essentially a diatribe against modernism, but
          includes anecdotal information about his upbringing, his studies with Schenker, and his
          career as a teacher in Duisburg and Hamburg. Cube also wrote a quantity of chamber music,
          songs, and concertos, some of which were performed by North German Radio.</p>

          <head>Correspondence with Schenker</head>
        <p>Cube and Schenker corresponded extensively between 1924 and 1934: OJ 9/34 (Cube to
          Schenker: 1925-34: 42 items) and letters in family possession: vC (Schenker to Cube:
          1924-34: 51 items); correspondence between Schenker and Violin comprise OJ 70/2 (1 item)
          and 70/11 (1931: 3 items).</p>
