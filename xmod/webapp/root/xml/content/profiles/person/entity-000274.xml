      <div>
        <p>Bass vocalist who performed some of Schenker's songs, and sang under Schenker's
          baton.</p>

        <p>Gärtner was also sometimes accompanied by Schenker (programme notes survive in OJ 35/5
          for Lieder evenings on January 26, 1900, March 19, 1902, and a chamber concert on January
          13, 1911). He was involved in the abortive attempt by Schenker and others to set up an
            "<ref cRef="organization_artists">organization of creative and performing
          artists</ref>". He was also a regular recipient of complimentary copies of Schenker's
          publications.</p>

        <p>A sour note was introduced in Schenker's diary when, discussing unscrupulousness in the
          business world, he remarks (November 19, 1911): "I myself think of Eduard Gärtner, who for
          years took advantage of my help, and just on that very account considered himself
          especially smart, but who at the same time was so dissipated [...] as to snub his
          helper."</p>

        <p>Gärtner's wife was Poldi Gärtner, and the couple had two sons, Hans and Ernst.</p>

        <head>Correspondence with Schenker</head>
        <p>Gärtner's correspondence with Schenker survives as OJ 5/12 (Schenker to Gärtner: 1912: 1
          item), 11/17 (Gärtner to Schenker: 1912,1918: 3 items).</p>
