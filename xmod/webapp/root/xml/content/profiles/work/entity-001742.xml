      <head><title>Der Tonwille</title>, Heft 3 (1922)</head>
      <div>
        <p>The third issue of Schenker's periodical <ref cRef="entity-001739">
            <title level="j">Der Tonwille</title>
          </ref> (1921–24).</p>
        <div>
          <head>Contents</head>
          <p>Issue 3, 40 pages in length, comprises just one of each of the three main <title level="j">Tonwille</title> article types: an article on a single work (19 pages), a
            theoretical article (4 pages), and <title level="a">Miscellanea</title> (13 pages of
            small type). The lead article forms the third of a "trilogy" of articles (though
            Schenker does not characterize them as such) on piano sonatas of Haydn (E-flat, Hob.
            XVI:52), Mozart (A minor, K. 310), and Beethoven (Op. 2, No. 1) that spans issues 2 and
            3. The second article begins in dialogue form, ending as a polemic against two
            19th-century editors, <ref cRef="entity-000110">Hans von Bülow</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000445">Karl Klindworth</ref>. </p>
          <p>The <title level="a">Miscellanea</title> was an object of sharp dispute between
            Schenker and Hertzka. Its contents had been mostly destined for issue 2 but Hertzka had
            objected to some of the material and issue 2 was published without any <title level="a">Miscellanea.</title> It was then considered for publication as a separate booklet;
            but ultimately was deferred to issue 3 with an article against <ref cRef="entity-000057">Paul Bekker</ref> and some anti-French material omitted.</p>

          <head>Publication History</head>
          <p>The main work on the Haydn sonata was done in March and June–August 1922, much of it
            while on vacation in the Tyrol; <title level="a">Die Kunst zu hören</title> was written
            on August 30, 1922, after his return to Vienna; and the whole issue delivered to UE on September 4, 1922. It was
            sent to the printer on September 14 (OC 52/327), and was published on January 19, 1923
            (OC 52/339). </p>
