        <p>Facsimile edition, edited by Schenker, with introduction, of Beethoven, Piano Sonata in
          C# minor, Op. 27, No. 2 ("Moonlight"). </p>
        <p>The facsimile was published by Universal Edition in 1921, with publication number UE
          7000. In UE's <title level="m">Nummernverzeichnis</title>, it is subtitled "Luxusausgabe"
          ("Luxury edition"); an English edition was planned, with publication number UE 7000a. It
          was the first volume in a series edited by Otto Erich Deutsch, the remainder of which can
          be seen listed below.</p>

        <head>Publication History</head>
        <p>Otto Erich Deutsch had obtained Emil Hertzka's agreement at Universal Edition for a
          series informally titled "Connoisseur Prints" by early January 1920, the facsimile of the
          "Moonlight" Sonata by Schenker being designated as the first volume in the series (OJ
          10/3, [5]). The contract for the volume is dated December 16, 1920 (OC 52/485). Schenker
          handed over the materials for the volume to Hertzka on July 2, 1921 (OC 52/229), and the
          volume was released in about November 1921 (OJ 10/3, [25]). </p>

        <head>Paul Bekker's review</head>
        <p>Among the reviews of this work was an unfavorable one in 1922 by the chief music critic
          of the <title level="j">Frankfurter Zeitung</title>, <ref cRef="bekker_paul">Paul
          Bekker</ref>, author of a book on Beethoven (1911). In the "secondary literature" sections
          of the <title level="m">Erläuterungsausgabe</title> of late Beethoven sonatas (1913–20),
          Schenker had repeatedly criticized opinions expressed in that book; and for that on Op.
          101 he wrote a lengthy rejoinder, which Hertzka suppressed at proof stage, to an article
          by Bekker entitled <title level="a">Criticism and Personality.</title></p>
        <p>After a brief history of facsimile production, enumerating the advantages of facsimiles,
          Bekker proceeded to give favorable coverage to two facsimile editions by Drei Masken
          Verlag, then continuing: <cit>
            <q>At the same time, Universal Edition of Vienna is publishing facsimile prints of
              Beethoven's C#-minor Sonata, Op. 27, and of three songs by Brahms, "Mainacht,"
              "Sapphische Ode," and "Nachtwandler." The technical execution of the reproduction
              here, too, is laudable, the external make-up is less auspiciously handled. For a
              start, I regret that it was considered appropriate to include the expression
              "Moonlight Sonata" in the title of the Beethoven work. Still more unwelcome with
              facsimile prints, in which each beholder seeks direct contact with the composer, is
              the effect of superfluous and sterile introductions by the editors: Kalbeck's prolixly
              turgid expatiations about Brahms just as much so as the ridiculous comments by
              Schenker on Beethoven’s autograph along with his "Urlinie." If such personal
              expectorations have to be published at all, then at least they are out of place in
              this context, and actually spoil the impression of such a publication.</q>
          </cit>
        </p>
        <p>Upon seeing this review, Schenker resurrected the suppressed rejoinder and recast it for
            <title level="j">Der Tonwille</title> issue 2, including a polemical response to the
          above criticism, remarking at one point: <cit>
            <q>Can one not see clearly how Bekker begrudges me my objectivity, only to denigrate it
              as a "personal expectoration" just for the sake of denigrating me? Pure vengeance,
              which only proves that he finds "personal expectoration" in matters of art – exactly
              as I do – insipid and iniquitous. Moreover, he appears to rely for support on the
              widely read <title level="j">Frankfurter Zeitung</title>, in whose services he is
              engaged. […] I can say boldly that I am stronger than Bekker and his paper – his
              shield – because I am engaged in services of the aristocracy of genius. […] And so he
              should learn to be modest; otherwise he should say wherein I have been factually
              incorrect in my criticism of him. […] </q>
          </cit></p>
        <p>However, Hertzka refused to publish it in this form, too, this refusal contributing in
          part to the deferral of all "Miscellanea" from issue 2 to issue 3, and thus to the further
          deterioration of relations between Schenker and UE. The item remained unpublished in
          German.</p>
