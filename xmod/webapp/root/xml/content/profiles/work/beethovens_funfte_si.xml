      <div>
        <p>Monograph publication of Schenker's study of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony – the first of
          three large-scale symphonic studies written in the 1920s, the other two being those of
          Mozart's Symphony No. 40 in G minor (<title level="j">Meisterwerk II</title>, 1926), and
          Beethoven's "Eroica" Symphony (<title level="j">Meisterwerk III</title>, 1930). In the
          longer term, it was the second of three studies of Beethoven symphonies that Schenker
          upheld as supreme masterworks: the Ninth (1912), the Fifth (1920/25), and the Third
          (1930).</p>
        <p>Schenker wrote his study of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony between 1920 and late 1923, which
          were published first in three installments in <title level="j">Tonwille</title>
          <ref cRef="tonwille1">Heft 1</ref> (1921), <ref cRef="tonwille5">Heft 5</ref> (1923;
          actually Feb 1924), and <ref cRef="tonwille6">Heft 6</ref> (1923; actually April 1924)
          over the fictitious imprint "Tonwille-Flugblätterverlag," and thereafter together as a
          monograph over Universal Edition's own imprint [UE 7646]. </p>
        <p>The first approach by UE to discuss the possibility of monograph publication came on May
          5, 1924 (diary, OJ 3/6, p. 2662), and the monograph was publicized as early as August of
          that year (<title level="j">Tonwille</title>
          <ref cRef="tonwille7">Heft 7 [=IV/1]</ref>). Schenker gave his imprimatur to the proofs on
          June 2, 1925 (WSLB 366), submitted a new abbreviations list in the August (OC 52/791-792),
          and returned the proof of this on September 12 (OC 52/794; WSLB 367); the work went to
          press in mid-September and was released on October 12 (OC 52/525) at a price of 3 Marks
          (OC 5/526). </p>

        <head>Differences between serial and monograph publications</head>
        <p>The text and music examples of the three installments were left untouched in the
          monograph format; the only two new elements were the revised abbreviations list (to
          reflect the latest version of Schenker's bibliography) and pagination in a single
          sequence. The figures retained their original numbering, so ran in five separate
          sequences. It should be remembered that the entire publication process unfolded against
          the background of a catastrophic deterioration of relations between Schenker and UE. Had
          that not been so, Schenker might well have wanted to make structural alterations and some
          updating of content, but at this point he was anxious to see through publication of <title
            level="j">Tonwille</title> Heft 10 and extricate himself from his obligations to UE.</p>
