      <head>Die letzten fünf Sonaten von Beethoven (Erläuterungsausgabe)</head>
      <div>
        <p>Schenker's edition of four of the last five piano sonatas of Beethoven, published
          separately, and based in each case on surviving autograph manuscripts and early editions,
          and drawing on Gustav Nottebohm's publications and private notes. This edition is in each
          case accompanied by Schenker's elucidations (<hi rend="italic">Erläuterungen</hi>); these
          describe the sources, analyze structure and thematic content (with copious music examples,
          and in the case of Op. 101 Urlinien), provide detailed guidelines for performance, and
          encompass a survey of the previous secondary literature and editions. The four volumes
          were published by Universal Edition of Vienna between 1913 and 1921.</p>

        <p>The format of each volume is the same: <list type="simple">
            <item><hi rend="italic">Vorwort</hi>: a short, dated foreword</item>
            <item>Schenker’s edition of the sonata</item>
            <item><hi rend="italic">Vorbemerkung zur Einführung</hi>: preliminary remarks, often
              polemical in character</item>
            <item><hi rend="italic">Einführung</hi>: an analysis of the sonata, section by section,
              along with detailed discussion of the autograph score, early editions, and, for Op.
              110 and Op. 111, Beethoven’s sketches</item>
            <item><hi rend="italic">Literatur</hi>: extracts from writings about the sonata by A. B.
              Marx, Wilhelm von Lenz, Willibald Nagel, Paul Bekker, and others, together with
              Schenker's dismissive remarks about them; for Op. 101, Schenker also quotes from and
              comments on Nottebohm's account of the sketches.</item>
          </list></p>

        <p>The motivation for this edition was to discredit the 19th-century editions, not only of
          these works but of those of the German and Austrian classical composers in general,
          against which Schenker had for many years polemicized; to show that with the exception of
          fingerings little or no editorial intervention was usually required — i.e. that
          Beethoven's orthography, when correctly understood and explained, provided all that was
          needed for understanding a work's structure and performing it according to his wishes; and
          ultimately to reveal the processes of mind of a supreme "master" of musical composition —
          to uncover the workings of genius.</p>

        <p>To underscore a novel approach to editing, which seeks to understand the composer's
          intentions through his orthography, Schenker planned to begin each volume with a
          "Vorrede," a general introduction to the series. This does not survive; and it is possible
          that Schenker was not intending to write it until he had received assurance from <ref
            cRef="entity-000356">Emil Hertzka</ref>, director of Universal Edition, that such an
          essay could be included. Hertzka, ever mindful of the negative impact that Schenker's
          polemical tone could have not only upon the project but also on his publishing house,
          evidently objected to the "Vorrede"; and it was abandoned shortly before the first volume
          (Op. 109) went into production. (Schenker sent Hertzka a revised version of the <hi
            rend="italic">Vorbemerkung zur Einführung</hi> for Op. 109, to compensate for the loss
          of the "Vorrede.")</p>

        <p> Because these volumes were prepared for the most part during World War I, they served
          also as a principal vehicle for Schenker's German nationalist feelings, and his intense
          antipathy toward the nations of the West, and this polemical stratum of the work relates
          directly to the leading article <title level="a">Von der Sendung des deutschen
            Genies,</title> in the <ref cRef="entity-001740">first issue of <title level="j">Der
              Tonwille</title></ref> (1921), and his Preface to <ref cRef="entity-001727"><title
              level="m">Kontrapunkt 2</title></ref> (1922). (Indeed, Schenker told Hertzka that his
          "Vorrede" was addressed to the "youth," i.e. a new generation of musicians; this word
          appears in the subtitle of the <ref cRef="entity-001739"><title level="j"
            >Tonwille</title></ref> pamphlets.)</p>

        <p>The five volumes of the work, which were to have been published one per year (contract:
          OC 52/494, August 25, 1912) but for the impact of the war upon both Schenker's research
          and the commerce of publishing, were: <listBibl>

            <bibl> Because he was unable to locate the autograph score of Op. 106 (the manuscript is
              presumed lost), Schenker did not complete the last number in the series, though he
              left voluminous notes on the sonata. (See under "English Translation and Study,"
              below.) </bibl>

        <head>New Edition</head>
        <p>A new edition was produced in four separate, smaller-format volumes in 1971–72 by <ref
            cRef="entity-000412">Oswald Jonas</ref>, pupil of Schenker and Hans Weisse. Jonas
          excised from Schenker's original all the polemical material and the entire discussion of
          the secondary literature, and also replaced Schenker's editions of the sonatas by Erwin
          Ratz's edition of 1945 with the effect that the scores contradict some of the textual
          argument in Schenker's elucidations. </p>

        <head>English Translation and Study</head>
        <p>The recent English translation by John Rothgeb is likewise in four separate, small-format
          volumes and a website: <lb/><bibl><title level="m">Beethoven's Last Piano Sonatas: An
              Edition with Elucidation</title>, transl., ed. and annotated by <editor>John

          <listBibl>

          </listBibl></p>

        <p>This edition follows the text of Schenker's original, thereby restoring all the material
          that Jonas excised in his 1970‒71 edition. Significantly, it incorporates numerous
          annotations made by Schenker in his personal copies of the volumes (now in the Oster
          Collection). There are, in addition, explanatory and citational footnotes by Rothgeb, some
          of which incorporate observations made by Jonas. Schenker's surveys of the secondary
          literature appear not in the print volumes but on the website. The scores of the sonatas,
          however, appear neither in the print volume nor on the website.</p>

        <p>Complementary to this edition is the study of Op. 106 by Nicholas Marston, which amplies
          Schenker's unpublished work on the sonata (in the Oster Collection, OC 65):
