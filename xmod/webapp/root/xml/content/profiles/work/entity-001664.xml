      <head>Syrische Tänze</head>

      <div>
        <p>Set of four pieces for piano four-hands composed in the mid‒late 1890s, published in 1899
          with the inscription "dedicated to Baron <ref cRef="entity-000743">Alphons von
            Rothschild</ref>," premiered in January 1900, and subsequently orchestrated by <ref
            cRef="entity-000798">Arnold Schoenberg</ref> for performance in Berlin in November
          1903.</p>


        <div>
          <head>Four-hands Piano Version (1899)</head>

          <p>The work had a number of different titles at the compositional stage, including:
            "Dances or Suite on Jewish Folksongs" (<hi rend="italic">Tänze oder Suite nach jüdischen
              Volksweisen</hi>), "Hebrew Dances" (<hi rend="italic">Hebraische Tänze</hi>), and
            "Dances of the Hassidic Jews" (<hi rend="italic">Tänze der Chassidim</hi>).</p>

          <p>Having first been rejected by <ref cRef="entity-002890">Breitkopf &amp; Härtel</ref> of
            Leipzig (OJ 9/20, [19], June 28, 1899), the work was accepted by <ref
              cRef="entity-000946">Josef Weinberger</ref> of Vienna. Hofmeister's <title level="m"
              >Monatsbericht</title> records its publication in two volumes in October 1899. Of the
            title-page, Schenker complained that "instead of a regular orthodox Jew they have used a
            dancing girl" (Sbb B II 4429, letter to Busoni, November 6, 1899) The constituent
            movements are: <list type="simple">
              <item>vol. 1 No. 1 Andante espressivo, Allegro scherzando (D minor)</item>
              <item>vol. 1 No. 2 Allegro con fuoco (C minor)</item>
              <item>vol. 2 No. 1 Allegretto <supplied reason="abbreviation">dolcissimo</supplied> (G
                minor)</item>
              <item>vol. 2 No. 2 Allegro molto passionate (D major)</item>
            </list>
          </p>

          <p>Schenker sent copies to several pianists shortly after publication, including <ref
              cRef="entity-000105">Ignaz Brüll</ref>, who commented: "I believe that, through their
            distinctive melodic beauty and the skillful ‒ and original ‒ manner of their
            development, the <title level="m">Dances</title> will cause a sensation" (OJ 9/23, [4],
            November 7, 1899), and <ref cRef="entity-000116">Ferruccio Busoni</ref>, who had
            evidently played them through with <ref cRef="entity-000794">Artur Schnabel</ref> (<ref
              type="correspondence" cRef="O-5-18-33">OJ 5/18, 33</ref>, December 21, 1933), remarked
            "These pieces are touched by genius (<hi rend="italic">sind genial</hi>)" (OJ 9/27,
            [11], February 11, 1900). The <title level="m">Syrian Dances</title> were given their
            first public performance on January 26, 1900 in the Bösendorfer-Saal in Vienna, the
            pianists being Schenker himself and <ref cRef="entity-000913">Moriz Violin</ref>, the
            concert also involving the baritone <ref cRef="entity-000274">Eduard Gärtner</ref>.
            Schenker later stated that in addition to this performance he and Violin had performed
            them in "many private houses", and had played a selection of the pieces to <ref
              cRef="entity-000331">Eduard Hanslick</ref> (<ref type="correspondence"
              cRef="OJ-5-18-33">OJ 5/18, 33</ref>).</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <head>Orchestrated Version (1903)</head>

          <p>On August 25, 1903, <ref cRef="entity-000116">Busoni</ref> wrote asking
            Schenker's permission to include "an orchestrated selection from your <title level="m"
              >Syrian Dances</title>" in a series of orchestral concerts of "New and Rarely
            Performed Works" that he had initiated the previous year in Berlin (OJ 9/27, [12]). In
            response, Schenker recalled that <ref cRef="entity-000798">Arnold
              Schoenberg</ref> had been present at the first performance and had asked permission to
            orchestrate the pieces, upon which Schenker had referred him to the publisher. Schenker
            commented to Busoni that he had himself considered orchestrating them, and "had the
            sound of the orchestra clearly" in his head (Sbb B II 3549, letter to Busoni, c.
            September 1, 1903). Busoni invited Schoenberg to undertake the task, and all four dances
            were performed in the Beethoven-Saal, Berlin by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra under
              <ref cRef="entity-000609">José Vianna da Motta</ref> on November 5, 1900.
            Schenker recorded that a further performance was booked for Prague (diary, November 18,
            1903). Schoenberg's orchestration was never published and seems to have been lost.</p>

          <p>The disastrous reviews that this performance received from its Berlin critics probably
            influenced Schenker's decision soon after to abandon composition.</p>

          <head>Later revival</head>

          <p>Schenker remained proud of this work. In 1918, he reported playing it with <ref
              cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette</ref> (diary, September 15, 1918). In 1933,
            Oswald Jonas asked if Schenker had a spare copy (<ref type="correspondence"
              cRef="OJ-12-6_27">OJ 12/6, [27]</ref> and <ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-5-18-33"
              >OJ 5/18, 33</ref>). Schenker replied that he did not have one himself, but in
            February 1914 he had a copy sent to Jonas by Weinberger.</p>
