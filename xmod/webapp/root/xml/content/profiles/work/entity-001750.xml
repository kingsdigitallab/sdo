          <p>Volume I, 220 pages in length, comprises fifteen articles in all: ten short and
            analytical, three theoretical, one text-critical, and one polemical. Six of them have
            their roots in <ref cRef="entity-001739"><title level="j">Der Tonwille</title></ref>:
            the three mini-analyses of short preludes by <ref cRef="entity-00027">J. S. Bach</ref>
            continue the series of five published in <title level="j">Tonwille</title> 4 and 5;
              <title level="a">Further Considerations of the Urlinie</title> follows on from
            articles in <ref cRef="entity-001740"><title level="j">Tonwille</title> 1</ref> (<title
              level="a">The Urlinie: A Preliminary Remark</title>) and <ref cRef="entity-001741"
              >2</ref> (<title level="a">Yet Another Word on the Urlinie</title>); the <title
              level="a">Elucidations</title> are actually a reprint of the article published in <ref
              cRef="entity-001747"><title level="j">Tonwille</title> 8/9</ref>; and the <title
              level="a">Miscellanea</title> continues the series that has appeared in all but two
            issues. At the same time, three articles connect forward to <ref cRef="entity-001751"
                ><title level="j">Meisterwerk</title> II</ref>: the two analyses of Bach solo violin
            movements are matched by one of a Bach solo cello movement in volume II, and <title
              level="a">Further Considerations"</title> has its own direct sequel with the same
            title in volume II, where also <title level="a">Elucidations</title> was to be reprinted
            again.</p>

          <head>Production Chronology</head>
          <p>Work on the contents of this volume goes back to the fall of 1924. Schenker began
            drafting the three Bach short prelude analyses in that November, worked up the
            voice-leading graphs and music examples in December, finalizing all three articles in
            January 1925 with finishing touches in early June. The two Bach violin analyses were
            started in early January 1925, polished in February and finalized in late May. Schenker
            started work on the two <ref cRef="entity-000129">Chopin</ref> Etude analyses in
            mid-January 1925, polished them in mid‒late April, finalizing them at the end of May.
            The two <ref cRef="entity-000760">Scarlatti</ref> sonata items were started in early
            April and completed in late May. The Op. 110 piece took only seven days, April 28 to May
            4, 1925.</p>

          <p>The text-critical <title level="a">Abolish the Phrasing Slur</title> was written
            between late February and early June 1925. It was a response to an article by <ref
              cRef="entity-000209">Walter Engelsmann</ref>, which was itself preceded by an exchange
            of letters between Engelsmann and Schenker. The essay represents the most significant
            published "updating" of a Schenkerian analysis by Schenker himself: he also provides
            foreground graphs of extracts of the first movement (Figs. 7 and 12) and a complete
            middleground reduction of the Allegro molto (Fig. 8), things which were unthinkable back
            in 1914 when the <ref cRef="entity-001735"><title level="m"
              >Erläuterungsausgabe</title></ref> of the work was published.</p>

          <p>The two theoretical articles (other than the much earlier <title level="a"
              >Elucidations</title>) were produced in 1925. The first idea for <title level="a">The
              Art of Improvisation</title> occurred to Schenker on February 23, the work spreading
            over fourteen weeks to early June; it proceeded by sections, the <ref
              cRef="entity-001720">C. P. E. Bach</ref> materials in mid-March, the Handel preludes
            in late March, the "introduction and epilogue" in early April, the graphs polished in
            mid-May, with <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette Schenker</ref> taking dictation and
            writing up drafts at various stages, eventually producing the fair copy, all being
            finished on June 2. Work on <title level="a">Further Considerations of the
              Urlinie</title> was underway before March 20, when Schenker dictated a rough version
            to Jeanette; work continued section by section throughout April, preparation of the <ref
              cRef="entity-000798">Schoenberg</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-002793">Stravinsky</ref>
            section in the final week of that month (all of this charted in his diary), and the
            final version was produced May 22‒24.</p>

          <p>Schenker first referred to the <title level="a">Miscellanea</title> in December 1924,
            but the main work occupied only nine days, May 9‒17.</p>

          <p>The whole manuscript was packed up on June 3, 1925 and delivered to <ref
              cRef="entity-002627">Drei Masken Verlag</ref>. Early in the following November, the
            publisher assigned the printing and engraving to <ref cRef="entity-002402"
              >Waldheim-Eberle</ref> (OC 54/42). (This was held up for a time because of the lack of
            "special characters" – i.e. careted numbers – in the engravers' type-set: OC 54/43.)
            Schenker began receiving galley-proofs of the letterpress around November 28 (OC 54/45),
            at which point he submitted the text of his Foreword (OC 54/48).</p>

          <p>He records returning corrected first galley-proofs between December 9 and 15. Second
            galleys circulated in January 1926 (OC 54/59, 60), proofs of the engraved work and small
            music examples (<hi rend="italic">Klischees</hi>) in February, first page-proofs were
            returned on March 1 (OC 54/67), and Schenker seems to have given his overall imprimatur
            in April (OC 54/75), although some revisions trickled on into May. One copy of the
            volume was finally delivered to Schenker on June 11 ‒ the very day on which he submitted
            the manuscript of volume II! <title level="j">Meisterwerk</title> I was apparently
            released on June 21 (diary and OC 54/90).</p>
