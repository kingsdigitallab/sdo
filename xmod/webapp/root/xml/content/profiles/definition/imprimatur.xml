      <div>
        <p>Literally "Let it be printed" (Latin, from <hi rend="italic">imprimere</hi>, "to print"). </p>
        <p>Used originally by ecclesiastical authorities or secular licensors to approve the
          publication of a book after examination of its contents, the term came into general use in
          both German and English as an indication by an author to a publisher that the typography
          and make-up of a work was ready for printing. </p>
        <p>Schenker gave his imprimatur to all of his works, with J. G. Cotta, Universal Edition,
          and Drei Masken Verlag, after having examined and corrected first the galley-proofs then
          one or two sets of page-proofs. Sometimes he would ask for a further set, not
          necessarily of the whole work, before being willing to give his go ahead, as in for
          example this case with <title level="m">Beethovens Neunte Sinfonie</title>: <cit>
            <q>Gatherings 9, 10, 12, and 13 get their imprimatur; as to gathering 11, unfortunately
              some pages are in a state of disorder as a result of carelessness; consequently, I
              would prefer to see yet a further proof, just to be on the safe side. (WSLB 106, April 14,
              1912).</q>
