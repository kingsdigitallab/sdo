      <head>Klischee [Klische; Klisché]</head>
      <div>
        <p>Term in printing denoting an engraved block (copper, zinc) or plate, and by inference a
          proof pulled from such a block or plate.</p>

        <p>In Schenker's work, Klischees were used for musical examples, small Urlinie graphs, and
          diagrams that appear in the course of text. The type for the surrounding text was set up
          first in galleys, proofs of which Schenker corrected, while simultaneously the examples
          were engraved on blocks, proof-pulls from which Schenker corrected. Then the galleys were
          subdivided into pages, at which stage the engraved blocks were embedded within the type.</p>

        <p>In the many places in correspondence where Schenker and Universal Edition speak of
          Klischees, and where in his diary Schenker speaks of receiving and correcting them,
          "Klischee" must be an abbreviation for "Klischeeabzug," a proof-pull from an engraved
          block, or possibly "Klischeekorrektur," a proof from an engraved block, since Schenker
          would have been unable to do anything with the block itself, which was printed in reverse.</p>

        <p>The sole occasion on which the term denoted the blocks themselves arises in a letter from
          Schenker's attorney listing items delivered to him by UE, which included "196 Klischees
          for <title level="j">Tonwille</title> Hefte 1–10 [and] 13 sheets of Klischee proof-pulls"
          (OC 52/538, December 18, 1925).</p>
