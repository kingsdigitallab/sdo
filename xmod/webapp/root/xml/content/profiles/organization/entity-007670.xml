      <div>
        <p>The Conservatory began life as the Ada Clement Piano School in 1917, founded by <ref
            cRef="entity-007501">Ada Clement</ref> and Lillian Hodghead at 3435 Sacramento Street.
          In 1923 the School was renamed the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, offering also
          courses in the orchestral instruments and in chamber music. It was directed by <ref
            cRef="entity-005103">Ernest Bloch</ref> from 1925 to 1930, then by Clement and Hodghead
          to 1950. From 1951 to 1957 its director was <ref cRef="entity-007665">Albert Elkus</ref>,
          during whose years the Conservatory moved to 1201 Ortega Street, where it remained until
          its move to 50 Oak Street in 2006.</p>

        <p><ref cRef="entity-000913">Moriz Violin</ref>, having emigrated from Vienna to San
          Francisco in 1939, aspired to join the ranks of the teaching faculty. It is unclear
          whether, despite his having talked to people influential in San Francisco musical circles,
          he was ever employed by the Conservatory.</p>
