      <head>Mannes Music School</head>

      <div>
        <p>Classical music conservatory in New York City, founded by David Mannes and Clara Damrosch
          in 1916 as the David Mannes Music School, its title changing in 1953 to the Mannes College
          of Music. The school was originally located on E. 70th Street, then on E. 74th Street, and
          since 1984 at 150 W. 85th Street.</p>

        <head>The Mannes School and Schenker' Theory</head>
        <p>The David Mannes Music School was the primary focal point for the dissemination of
          Schenker's theory in the USA (thus in effect in Europe, since World War II), and has
          played a crucial role in that ever since. (Though it is reported that as early as 1925
            <ref cRef="entity-000939">George A. Wedge</ref> was lecturing at another New York
          school, the <ref cRef="entity-002437">Institute of Musical Art</ref>, founded by Mannes's
          brother-in-law, Frank Damrosch, on the "Urlinie" (OJ 3/8, p. 2,876).) In 1931, Schenker's
          pupil <ref cRef="entity-000951">Hans Weisse</ref> was appointed—perhaps at the suggestion
          of <ref cRef="entity-000934">Gerald F. Warburg</ref> ‒ to the staff of the school to teach
          composition, theory, and analysis according to Schenker's theory, and taught there until
          his death in 1940. In 1932, the school sponsored the publication of Schenker's <ref
            cRef="entity-001755"><title level="m">Fünf Urlinie-Tafeln</title></ref>. Weisse is known
          from his letters to Schenker to have taught classes on the article and graphs of
          Beethoven's "Eroica" Symphony in Schenker's <ref cRef="entity-001752"><title level="m">Das
              Meisterwerk in der Musik</title>, vol. III</ref>, and a seminar on <ref
            cRef="entity-001728"><title level="m">Der freie Satz</title></ref>, and to have used the
            <title level="m">Fünf Urlinie-Tafeln</title> as teaching material, and from the School's
          prospectuses to have taught such courses as "Creative Hearing," and "The Theory of Dr.
          Heinrich Schenker."</p>

        <p>Weisse was succeeded by <ref cRef="entity-000754">Felix Salzer</ref>, who had been his
          pupil in Vienna, and subsequently Schenker's (1931–35); the foundational program at
          Mannes, "Techniques of Music," integrating musicianship, theory, and performance on the
          basis of Schenker's theory, was created by Salzer in 1953. Among those Schenkerian
          thinkers who have taught at Mannes since Weisse are Adele T. Katz (1936: at the
          Westchester Branch), Roy Travis (1952–57), Carl Schachter (1956–2015), Allen Forte
          (1957–60), William Mitchell (1957–68), Ernst Oster (1970–77), Edward Laufer (1973–75), and
          Eric Wen (2008‒13.</p>

        <p>In 1989 the College became part of the New School for Social Research, and in 2005
          changed its name to the Mannes College the New School for Music.</p>
