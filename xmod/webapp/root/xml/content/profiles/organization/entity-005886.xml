        <p>The Music Department of Columbia University was founded in 1896 by Edward McDowell.
          Subsequent heads of department were Daniel Gregory Mason and Douglas Moore. A graduate
          program in historical musicology was established in the 1930s under the leadership of Paul
          Henry Lang. Lectures and graduate seminars in Schenkerian theory were given at Columbia by
            <ref cRef="entity-000951">Hans Weisse</ref> in the 1930s, and a year after Weisse's
          death in 1940 a graduate program in music theory was established by <ref
            cRef="entity-006980">William J. Mitchell</ref>, who had studied with Weisse in Vienna in
          1930â€’32 and taught at Columbia until 1968 (when he joined the music theory faculty at SUNY
          Binghamton). Patricia Carpenter, a student of Arnold Schoenberg, received her PhD in music
          theory from Columbia in 1972, and as a member of faculty of Barnard College was head of
          graduate music theory at Columbia, establishing a seminar sequence in history of music
          theory. Carpenter retired in 1989, after which the theory program was led by Jonathan
          Kramer and Fred Lerdahl.</p>
