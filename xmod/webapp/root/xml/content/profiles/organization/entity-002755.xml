      <div>
        <p>Viennese radio station, founded in 1924; also its accompanying magazine, <title level="j"
            >Radio-Wien</title>.</p>

        <p>Radio Wien was launched on October 1, 1924 as part of a wider national radio network <ref
            cRef="entity-004436">RAVAG</ref> under the aegis of which Radio Wien operated until
          1938. At first it transmitted from its studios, but after about a year it began making
          outside broadcasts from an increasing range of locations such as opera and operetta
          houses, concert and recital halls, theaters and many other types of venues, from other
          Austrian cities, and abroad.</p>

        <p>During World War II the network was incorporated into the German radio system. From April
          1945 Radio Wien was relaunched and continues to the present.</p>

        <p>Heinrich and Jeanette acquired a radio receiver within three weeks of the launching of
          Radio Wien, taking delivery on October 20, 1924. At first they each had a headset, then
          after a year they acquired a loudspeaker, making it possible from the later 1920s to invite
          other people in to join them. They listened to orchestral concerts, opera, light opera,
          light and popular music, folk music, occasionally to jazz and contemporary music, and
          plays as well as readings, talks and lectures on a wide range of topics. There are more
          than 1,000 entries in Schenker’s diaries documenting items heard on the radio, many
          including critiques.</p>
