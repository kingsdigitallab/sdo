      <head>Associated Music Publishers, Inc.</head>
      <div>
        <p>Music agency and publisher based in New York City.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Associated Music Publishers (AMP) was founded in 1927 by Paul Heinicke, originally as a
          sole American agency for leading European music publishing houses, including <ref
            cRef="entity-002408">Universal Edition</ref> of Vienna. The firm later built up a
          substantial published list of compositions by American composers such as Carter, Cowell,
          Harris, Piston, and Riegger. <ref cRef="entity-000968">Hugo Winter</ref>, one of the three
          co-directors of UE after 1932, emigrated to the USA in 1938 and later became
          Vice-President of AMP.</p>

        <p>The firm was acquired by G. Schirmer in 1964, then by Macmillan Inc. in 1968, Schirmer
          and AMP being subsequently acquired by the Music Sales Group in 1986. AMP continued to add
          leading American composers such as Adams, Corigliano, and Harbison to its list.</p>

      <div>
        <head>AMP and Schenker</head>
        <p>At the time (1932‒c.1935) that an abbreviated schools version of Schenker's <ref
            cRef="entity-001724"><title level="m">Harmonielehre</title></ref> by <ref
            cRef="entity-000922">Otto Vrieslander</ref> was under consideration by <ref
            cRef="entity-002408">Universal Edition</ref> in Vienna, either an English-language
          translation of this edition by <ref cRef="entity-000951">Hans Weisse</ref> (who by this
          time was living in <ref cRef="entity-002873">New York</ref> and teaching at the <ref
            cRef="entity-002454">David Mannes Music School</ref>), or an American edition and
          translation by Weisse, seems to have been floated, the latter to be issued by AMP, but
          Weisse rejected the idea unconditionally. The matter is discussed in a letter from Weisse
          to Schenker of March 15, 1934 (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-15-16_94">OJ 15/16,
            [94]</ref>), and ultimately came to nothing.</p>
