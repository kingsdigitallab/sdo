      <head>Institute of Musical Art</head>

      <div>
        <p>Musical conservatory founded by Frank Damrosch (1859â€“1937) in New York in 1905 as an
          alternative to the European conservatories to which American musicians were previously
          obliged to go for advanced study.</p>

        <p>The Institute was the basis of what would become in 1926, after the establishment of the
          Juilliard Music Foundation and the creation of a graduate music school in 1924, by merger
          of the two the Juilliard School of Music. The Institute was initially located on Fifth
          Avenue at 12th Street, but in 1910 moved to Claremont Avenue (now the location of the
          Manhattan School of Music).</p>

      <div>
        <head>The Conservatory and Schenker</head>
        <p>The Institute's importance at an early date to the Schenkerian world lies in the fact
          that <ref cRef="entity-000939">George A. Wedge</ref>, who had studied there, and then
          became a teacher and the dean of the Institute, used Schenkerian theoretical ideas in his
          teaching from at least 1925.</p>
