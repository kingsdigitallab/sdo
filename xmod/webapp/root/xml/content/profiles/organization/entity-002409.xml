        <p>German company manufacturing steel, ammunition, and armaments.</p>
        
        <p>Friedrich Krupp (1787–1826) established a steel foundry in Essen in 1810. His son, Alfred
          Krupp (1812–87), continued the company, making steel canons for the Russian, Turkish, and
          Prussian armies. <ref cRef="entity-000488">Gustav von Bohlen</ref>, husband of the family
          heiress Bertha Krupp, who changed his name to Krupp, led the company from 1909 to 1941,
          supplying weapons to the German army in both world wars. His son, Alfried Krupp, a strong
          supporter of Hitler and Nazism, took over in 1941, and during that era, the company
          commandeered the industries of many occupied countries, and used slave labor drawn from
          concentration camps and civilian populations. Alfried and his co-defendents were convicted
          at the Krupp trial of crimes against humanity, and imprisoned, but subsequently amnestied,
          and Alfried was allowed to resume control of the company. The firm has continued to trade,
          and in 1999 became Thyssen Krupp Stahl AG. </p>
