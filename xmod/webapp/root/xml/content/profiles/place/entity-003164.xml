      <div>

        <p>The Botanical Garden of the University of Vienna, in the third district (Landstraße) of
          Vienna.</p>

        <p>Bordered nowadays by the <ref cRef="entity-002293">Belvedere Gardens</ref> to the west,
          the <ref cRef="entity-002336">Rennweg</ref> and Mechelgasse to the north, the <ref
            cRef="entity-002898">Jacquingasse</ref> to the east, and the Landstraßer Gürtel to the
          south, the <hi rend="italic">Hortus Botanicus Vindobonensis</hi> was founded by the
          Empress Maria Theresa in 1754 in connection with the University's medical faculty. Robert
          Laugier (1722‒93) was its first director, and Nikolaus von Jacquin (1727‒1817) his
          successor. Its plants were classified according to the Linnean system. The original
          greenhouses were replaced by new ones in 1890‒93. The Garden was severely damaged by
          bombing in World War II, and was rebuilt and restored in the 1970s. </p>

        <head>The Botanical Garden and the Schenkers</head>
        <p>Even before they moved to the <ref cRef="entity-002826">Keilgasse</ref>, Heinrich and
          Jeanette Schenker used to visit the Garden from <ref cRef="entity-002277"
            >Reisnerstraße</ref>. Once established at Keilgasse 8 from May 1921, they were within a
          hundred yards of the <ref cRef="entity-002898">Jacquingasse</ref> gate and often took
          walks in the Garden, singly or together, Schenker sometimes taking proofs or other work to
          do there, or reading a book or newspaper. These visits are noted frequently in Schenker's
          diary, with reports on the latest flowers in bloom ("2:00–3:15 in the Botanical Garden;
          Lie-Liechen collects fall foliage from the gingko, etc." ‒ Oct 29, 1923; "1:45–2:45 in the
          Botanical Garden: crocus! primroses!" ‒ April 2, 1925), and their interactions with the
          Garden's staff ("After teatime into the Botanical Garden with tobacco for the old
          attendant, then through the Belvedere and home." ‒ Oct 16, 1924).</p>
