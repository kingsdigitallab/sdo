      <head>Munich</head>
      <div>
        <p>Capital city of Bavaria, and a major cultural center in Germany; located on the River
          Isar, north of the Bavarian Alps.</p>

        <head>Munich and Schenker</head>
        <p>For many years, Schenker's contact with Munich came through his pupil <ref
            cRef="vrieslander_otto">Otto Vrieslander</ref> who, having studied there 1904–11, lived
          in nearby Ebersberg from 1912 to 1924. Another important contact was <ref
            cRef="roth_herman">Herman Roth</ref>, who lived in Munich from 1910 to 1920 and again
          1932 to 1935. <ref cRef="hoboken_anthony_van">Anthony van Hoboken</ref> also lived there
          during World War I and spent time there in the mid-1920s. <ref cRef="cube_felixeberhard_v"
            >Felix-Eberhard von Cube</ref> also grew up in Munich, and studied for a time with
          Vrieslander before going to Vienna to work directly under Schenker's supervision.</p>
        <p>Vrieslander was apparently trying to engineer an appointment for Schenker in Munich in
          1919, for Schenker wrote to Hertzka (UE) on December 17, 1919: <cit>
            <q>By the time I am finished with that [<title level="m">Op. 101</title>] I hope to know
              for certain whether I am going to Munich, in what capacity, whether I shall be giving
              lectures there at the Akademie [der Tonkunst] or elsewhere. (WSLB 310) </q>
          </cit></p>
        <p>The music historian <ref cRef="einstein_alfred">Alfred Einstein</ref> was also based in
          Munich, and it was through him, with Otto Vrieslander acting as intermediary, that
          Schenker's most lasting link with the city – which had long been a leading center of
          publishing in Germany – came about, namely the publication of <title level="m">Das
            Meisterwerk in der Musik</title> (1925, 1926, 1930) by Drei Masken Verlag of Munich, the
          extensive correspondence with which, comprising some 330 items and spanning 1924–32, is
          preserved as OC 54. </p>
