        <p>Photographic studio, located at Vienna I, Opernring 1 (Kärntnerstraße 42), close to the
          Vienna State Opera. The studio still exists, under the name Foto Fayer, at A‒101 Vienna,
          Opernring 6.</p>

        <p>Karl Pietzner (1853‒1927) and Georg Fayer (1892‒1950) were internationally celebrated
          photographers at the time, owning studios in a number of cities. The Ringstraße studio
          seems to have been established in 1926, those responsible being Georg and Sonja Fayer. In
          the 1930s, the studio was doing not only photography of many kinds but also cinematography
          and certain kinds of painting.</p>

        <p>The studio was hired by the committee of the Beethoven Centennial Celebration of March
          26‒30, 1927 to create a photographic record in the form of an album of portraits of all
          the participants, including those of the conference that was held in conjunction with the
          celebration. Since Schenker had been invited to serve as a member of the executive
          committee, and also to give a paper, he was included in the invitation to be photographed,
          and so received a letter from the studio (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-11-1_1">OJ
            11/1, [1]</ref>, May 10, 1927), to which he replied that he did not belong in the album.
          — In November 1928, Jeanette Schenker had photographic portraits of herself done at the
          studio.</p>
