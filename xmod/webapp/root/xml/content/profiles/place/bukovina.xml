      <head>Bukovina [Bukowina]</head>
      <div>

        <p>Crown land of Austria-Hungary, located south-east of Galicia and east of the Kingdom of
          Hungary, capital city <ref cRef="czernowitz_cernauti">Czernowitz</ref>. In 1919, by the
          Treaty of St. Germain, Bukovina was recognized as part of Romania. Heavily fought over
          during World War II, it was absorbed into the Soviet Union after 1945, since the collapse
          of which, Northern Bukovina, with its capital city, has been part of the Ukraine, Southern
          Bukovina, including <ref cRef="sereth">Sereth (Siret)</ref>, part of Romania.</p>

        <p>Bukovina was a multi-ethnic (Ruthenian, Romanian, German, and other), multi-lingual
          country, of the population of which in 1910 Jews constituted 12.86%.</p>

        <p>Schenker's sister <ref cRef="guttmann_sophie_nee">Shifre (Sophie)</ref>, and her husband
            <ref cRef="guttmann_salo_dr_hus">Salo Guttmann</ref>, and their three children, lived in
          Sereth, Bukovina, until the Russian army invaded in September 1914, then fled to Vienna,
          returning to Bukovina after World War I, and probably moving in 1939 to Czernowitz, where
          their daughter Frieda (Schenker's grand-daughter) and family were living. In 1941&#x2013;42, the entire Jewish
          community of Northern Bukovina was deported to the death camps.</p>
