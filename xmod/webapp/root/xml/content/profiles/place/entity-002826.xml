      <head>Keilgasse</head>
      <div>

        <p>Since 1909, street in the 3rd district (Landstraße) of Vienna. </p>

        <p>The Keilgasse was formerly part of the Hohlweggasse. The name "Keilgasse" (literally
          "Wedge Street") was derived from the original shape of the street in the early 20th
          century. The street runs parallel with the <ref cRef="entity-00238">Fasangasse</ref> south
          of the latter's junction with the <ref cRef="entity-002336">Rennweg</ref> at the
          Fasanplatz. Only about 100 meters in length, it runs between the Gerlgasse and Hegergasse.
          The Botanical Garden of the University is located close by, on the opposite (west) side of
          the Fasangasse, and the <ref cRef="entity-002324">Aspang Bahnhof</ref> just north of the
          Keilgasse.</p>

        <p>Heinrich and <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette Schenker</ref> moved into Keilgasse 8 in
          May 1921 – their first home together since their marriage on November 10, 1919 – before
          which they had been living separately in the <ref cRef="entity-002277">Reisnerstraße</ref>
          and <ref cRef="entity-002257">Streichergasse</ref>, from which the Keilgasse was only a
          few minutes' walk – after an arduous fifteen-month search for accommodation. As he
          commented: <cit>
            <q>Now we are in our home. For the first time we can both betake ourselves to the same
              apartment, the same room, after so many years of being torn apart, a fulfillment which
              makes us all the happier because it has been so difficult to achieve. (OJ 3/2, p.
              2385)</q>

        <p>Their apartment was No. 12 (Tür 12), and they had procured the rental of it by May 7, and
          moved in about May 20. Heinrich described his room to <ref cRef="entity-000913">Moriz
            Violin</ref> in a letter of June 13, 1921 (OJ 6/7, [1]), when it was still full of
          painters, cleaners, and electricians: <cit>
            <q>It [...] offers me all the conveniences I could possibly wish for. In my room there
              are no fewer than three desks, each for a specific purpose: one for the "Theory"
              volumes, another for the Beethoven edition, and the third <title level="j">Der
                Tonwille</title>. Lamps everywhere, and my own writing materials, so that all I have
              to do is summon the physical strength needed to bring this quantity of work to a
              conclusion.</q>

        <p>The diary for May and June 1921 provides much description of the apartment and its
          renovations. At the end of August, Schenker wrote: <cit>
            <q>our apartment fulfils all the requirements we could muster. It gives me and
              Lie-Liechen the opportunity for work in comfort, for quietude, for pleasure; it has
              rooms and corners which, with the passing of time, will hopefully be carpeted with
              [our] blessings. (OJ 3/2, p. 2386)</q>
          </cit></p>

        <p>The couple lived there until Heinrich's death in January 1935. Thereafter, Jeanette seems
          to have remained only until November of the same year.</p>

        <p>Six photographs of the interior of the apartment (four of them taken by the Atelier
          Meroth, Rennweg 17) survive in the Oswald Jonas Memorial Collection as OJ 72/19, showing
          the living room, the music room, and Heinrich's study-bedroom.</p>
