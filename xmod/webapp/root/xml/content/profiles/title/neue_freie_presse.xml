        <p> Vienna's leading liberal
          daily newspaper, founded by Max Friedl&#xE4;nder in 1864. </p>
          
          <p>The paper appeared from
          September 1, 1864 until January 31, 1939. It had a distinguished array of contributors,
          was modern in its style of journalism and technology, and was at its height a newspaper of
          world rank, issuing morning and evening editions (<title level="j">Morgenblatt</title> and
            <title level="j">Abendblatt</title>) on some days of the week. The paper covered
          international news, local news, business, the world's stock markets, culture, and the
          arts. An important feature was its feuilleton, which occupied the bottom inches of the
          first few pages of the morning edition on several days a week, running continuously from
          page to page. The heart of the artistic coverage appeared in the daily section "Theater
          and Art News" (Theater- und Kunstnachrichtung).</p>
        
        <p>Its chief editor from 1908 to his death in 1920 was <ref cRef="benedikt_moriz">Moriz
            Benedikt</ref>, whose association with the paper extended back to 1872. Its Paris
          correspondent from 1891 was the founder of Zionism, Theodor Herzl. Its music critic from
          1864 to his death in 1904 was Eduard Hanslick; Julius Korngold succeeded him, serving from
          1904 to 1934. All were men of great influence in their different capacities.</p>

          <head>The <title level="j">Neue Freie Presse</title> and Schenker</head>
          
        <p>Schenker read the <title level="j">Neue Freie Presse</title> every day, and his diaries are
          full of quotations from and reactions to its articles. He read the world news assiduously;
          he also read the feuilletons and kept abreast of the cultural news and in particular of
          musical events. On at least one occasion, he inserted an announcement (June 3, 1911).
          Schenker also instructed his publishers to send a review copy of each of his newly
          published works to the paper.</p>
          
          <p>Only one postcard from the paper's editors to Schenker is preserved (OC 50/13: 1931), and no correspondence in the reverse direction is known to survive. </p>
