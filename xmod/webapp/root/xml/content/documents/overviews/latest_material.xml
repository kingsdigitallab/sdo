                <head>OSWALD JONAS CORRESPONDENCE</head>

                <p>The 20-year-long exchanges between Jonas and Schenker ‒ spanning 1918 to 1938 ‒
                    constitute one of the most important narratives among the Schenker
                    correspondences. Jonas was Schenker's pupil 1918‒20, and thereafter studied with
                    Hans Weisse. His value to Schenker increased during the 1930s with the emergence
                    of his book <title level="m">Das Wesen des musikalischen Kunstwerks</title>
                    (1934).</p>

                <p>The newly available material, covering 1932 to 1938, is dominated by the
                    preparation and publication of that book in parallel with Schenker's completion
                    of <title level="m">Der freie Satz</title>, and by the unpredictabilities of
                    Anthony van Hoboken as the financial backer of both works (something which
                    arouses Schenker’s indignation).</p>

                <p>With the coming to power of the Nazis, Jonas's work in Berlin rapidly diminishes
                    from early 1933. One by one doors close on him as a Jew. His situation becomes
                    increasingly difficult, but his comments to Schenker are always so guarded that
                    one has to read between the lines.</p>

                <p>In two striking letters ‒ OJ 5/18, 33 and 49 (Dec 21, 1933 and Aug 2, 1934) ‒
                    Schenker makes far-reaching statements about his own Jewishness.</p>

                <p>Jonas's communications with Jeanette Schenker after Heinrich's death allude to
                    her giving him privileged access to Heinrich's unpublished papers, and to his
                    plans with Salzer to found the periodical <title level="j">Der
                    Dreiklang</title>.</p>
