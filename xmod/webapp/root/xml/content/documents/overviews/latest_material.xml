                <p>The final eight months of Schenker's life are covered in a new batch that
                    completes the sequence from October 1917 to January 1935 — 17¼ years! Work has
                    now started at January 1912 and progressed to February 1913 [ed. <hi
                        rend="italic">Marko Deisinger</hi>, transl. <hi rend="italic">William
                        Drabkin</hi>]. Not only does the latter sequence present valuable
                    information about <title level="m">Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony</title> and the
                    beginnings of the <title level="m">Erläuterungsausgabe</title>, but it reveals a
                    Schenker engaged with social and political issues, writing mini-essays within
                    the diaries. — We will close the gap between 1913 and 1917 in the next three
                    years.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Dreams are a delightful facet of Schenker's diaries. Here he is
                        in 1934:</hi>
                    <cit>
                        <q>June 4: "I dream about Chopin: he sings the right-hand part of the Etude
                            Op. 25, No. 11, as fast as a pianist can play it, but with greater
                            transparency."</q>
                    </cit>
                    <cit>
                        <q>October 21: "Dream: Emperor Franz Joseph in his carriage amidst an
                            adoring crowd – from a great distance I behave as if passionately
                            blessed – the Emperor appears to sense my love and nods to me; he gets
                            out of his carriage and walks towards me, but is held up along the way
                            and I lose sight of him."</q>

                <head>CORRESPONDENCE</head>

                <p>All of the exchanges with <hi rend="bold">Universal Edition</hi> for 1909 (36
                    items) bring the present UE coverage to 214 items spanning 1901‒09 and 1918‒30 ‒
                    full of fascinating shadow-boxing between Schenker and Hertzka [ed. <hi
                        rend="italic">Ian Bent</hi>]. 1910‒11 will be our target for the next
                    upload. New also are the correspondence with state official <hi rend="bold"
                        >Ludwig Karpath</hi> (42), and the <hi rend="bold">Vienna Music Academy</hi>
                    and its directors Bopp, Marx, et al (26) [<hi rend="italic">Martin Eybl</hi>],
                    both including attempts to install Schenker as a professor.</p>

                <p>The sequence of <hi rend="bold">Hoboken</hi> correspondence [ed. <hi
                        rend="italic">John Rothgeb</hi>] continues, with 26 items from 1929‒32
                    (extending the sequence from 1924), and the first 10 items of the extraordinary
                    exchange with sculptor-typographer <hi rend="bold">Victor Hammer</hi> [<hi
                        rend="italic">Hedi Siegel</hi> and new contributor <hi rend="italic"
                        >Stephanie Probst</hi>]. Three new items to pupil Miss <hi rend="bold"
                        >Newlov</hi> include the following boast from 1913: <cit>
                        <q>September 25: "It is my practise to maintain the most stringent order
                            with all letters, correspondences, picture-postcards, [...] My
                            collection extends back over innumerable years, so that I have close to
                            20,000 letters on file. I therefore have in my possession all your <hi
                                rend="italic">letters, notes, postal order dates</hi>, in short <hi
                                rend="italic">everything</hi>, that you have written to me since I
                            have had the pleasure of your acquaintance." (OC 1A/27-29)</q>
                    </cit>"</p>

                <p>Among newly published profiles is one for the intriguing figure of <hi
                        rend="bold">Eva Boy</hi>, an "expressional dancer" (<hi rend="italic"
                        >Ausdruckstänzerin</hi>) and small-time writer, for whom Anthony van Hoboken
                    divorced his first wife in 1932 (the couple were unflatteringly portrayed in
                    Lion Feuchtwanger's novel <title level="m">Die Geschwister Oppermann</title>);
                    and the margarine manufacturer <hi rend="bold">Paul Khuner</hi>, a pupil of Hans
                    Weisse, who contributed 5,000 Austrian shillings toward the printing costs of
                        <title level="m">Der freie Satz</title>, an act of generosity that went
                    unacknowledged in Schenker's Foreword.</p>
