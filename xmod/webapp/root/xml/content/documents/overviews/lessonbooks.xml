                    <head>The nature of the lessonbooks</head>
                    <p>Over nearly 20 years, from 1912 to 1931, Schenker kept details of the piano
                        and theory lessons that he gave in his own apartment. Comprising 580 pages
                        in four bound volumes, these <hi rend="italic">Stundenbücher</hi> – written
                        by dictation in the hand of his companion (later wife) Jeanette, and
                        including many separate slips of paper ("lesson notes") in Heinrich's own
                        hand – record the musical works learned by each student, the features of
                        piano technique taught, the passages of his own theoretical works and those
                        of others – particularly in harmony, counterpoint, and thoroughbass –
                        assigned for reading and discussion, the written exercises done and graded,
                        the theoretical issues raised, the analyses conducted, and the studies made
                        of facsimiles of composers' autograph manuscripts and sketches and of early
                        printed editions. </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <head>Internal organization of the lessonbooks</head>
                    <p>There are two aspects of the organization of the lessonbooks that it is
                        important for users of this edition to understand. </p>

                    <div>
                        <head><hi rend="italic">Saison</hi></head>
                        <p>Each year of these lessonbooks mirrors Schenker's teaching year – what he
                            called his Saison – by running from October 1 of a given year to late
                            June of the next year. In this online edition, such a year is designated
                            as e.g. "1917/18", thus covering from October 1, 1917 to c. June 21,
                            1918. </p>

                    <div>
                        <head>Internal presentation</head>
                        <p>Schenker's method of organizing the contents of each year changed over
                            the years. He adopted two essentially different methods, with a
                            transitional period from the former to the latter, as follows. <lb/><lb/>
                            <hi rend="bold">19[11]/12 – 1914/15</hi> – arranged chronologically by
                            date, each date containing the lesson notes for the pupils of that date,
                            presumably in time order.<lb/><lb/>
                            <hi rend="bold">1915/16 – 1923/24</hi> – at first (1915/16), the saison
                            divided into months, with pupils arranged in alphabetical order within
                            each month; then (1916/17 – 1919/20) the year broken into two periods,
                            with pupils alphabetically within each period; then (1921/22 – 1923/24)
                            presented as single years, with pupils arranged alphabetically, but no
                            dates at the beginning of entries.<lb/><lb/>
                            <hi rend="bold">1924/25 – 1930/31</hi> – arranged by pupil in
                            alphabetical order, the lessons for each pupil given in chronological
                            order, with lesson date at the beginning of each entry </p>
                    </div>

                </div>

                <div>
                    <head>The value of the lessonbooks</head>
                    <p>This information is significant not only in charting the progress of
                        individual pupils, but also for the insights that it offers into Schenker's
                        teaching methods, and the way in which those methods changed over the years.
                        Of great interest is the comparison of those methods with his unpublished
                        work <title level="m">Die Kunst des Vortrags</title> (The Art of
                        Performance: 1911 and later). Of potentially even greater interest is the
                        determination of the extent to which his teaching influenced the works he
                        published over the period 1912 to 1935, many of which contain detailed
                        remarks on performance of specific works. </p>

                    <p>Another field of study opened up by the lessonbooks is the comparison of his
                        "school" of teaching with those of other famous Viennese teachers of his
                        day, such as Theodor Leschetizky, Richard Robert, and Emil Sauer, through
                        their publications and editions, and the words of their pupils. </p>
