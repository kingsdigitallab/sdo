                <p>Over nearly 20 years, from 1912 to 1931, Schenker kept details of the piano and
                    theory lessons that he gave in his own home. Comprising 580 pages in four bound
                    volumes, these <hi rend="italic">Stundenbücher</hi> — written by dictation in the
                    hand of his companion (later wife) Jeanette, and including many separate slips
                    of paper ("lesson notes") in Heinrich's own hand — record the musical works
                    learned by each student, the features of piano technique taught, the passages of
                    his own theoretical works and those of others — particularly in harmony,
                    counterpoint, and thoroughbass — assigned for reading and discussion, the written
                    exercises done and graded, the theoretical issues raised, the analyses
                    conducted, and the studies made of facsimiles of composers' autograph
                    manuscripts and sketches and of early printed editions. </p>

                <p>This information is significant not only in charting the progress of individual
                    pupils, but also for the insights that it offers into Schenker's teaching
                    methods, and the way in which those methods changed over the years. Of great
                    interest is the comparison of those methods with his unpublished work <title
                        level="m">Die Kunst des Vortrags</title> (The Art of Performance: 1911 and
                    later). Of potentially even greater interest is the determination of the extent
                    to which his teaching influenced the works he published over the period 1912 to
                    1935, many of which contain detailed remarks on performance of specific works. </p>

                <p>Another field of study opened up by the lessonbooks is the comparison of his
                    "school" of teaching with those of other famous Viennese teachers of his day,
                    such as Theodor Leschetizky, Richard Robert, and Emil Sauer, through their
                    publications and editions, and the words of their pupils. </p>
