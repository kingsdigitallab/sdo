                <p><hi rend="bold">Diary page covering January 27 to February 6, 1907 (OJ 1/6, p.
                        33)</hi></p>
                <p>Schenker's diary starts in 1896, but develops into a personal, day-to-day diary
                    only in 1906. The page shown here is representative of the events, personal
                    encounters, dealings with pupils, things read, and music heard, that he was
                    reporting in his immediately post-<hi rend="italic">Harmonielehre</hi>
                    period.</p>
                <p>The page exhibits the two styles of handwriting that Schenker employed in tandem.
                    His primary script is the distinctively German handwriting known as "Kurrent" or
                    "Sütterlinschrift"; but for personal names, place names, and foreign loanwords,
                    Schenker switched to "Lateinschrift" ‒ rather like Italic handwriting. There are
                    many examples of the latter on this page, e.g. in line 2: "Emanzipation," and in
                    the first line of the entry for January 30: "Tempi" and "Haydn."</p>
                <p>There are some fascinating critiques of concert performances. Comments include
                    performance practice (January 30), comparison of Michael and Joseph Haydn
                    (February 3), and censure of his old friend Eugen d'Albert (February 4). The
                    best known item is his diatribe against Schoenberg's First String Quartet
                    (February 5).</p>
                <p>Characteristically for the diary before 1911, the text is heavily revised, with
                    numerous crossings-out, overwritings, and interlinear insertions. On the final
                    page of the diary, dated January 22, 1935, Jeanette Schenker (who took over
                    writing up the diary in 1911 by dictation) remarked: "These 3,970 pages were
                    never intended for publication, but rather as a crutch for the memory, even
                    though much that is contained in them is interesting, instructive, and
                    illuminating." A page like that shown here bears out the second half of this
                    remark, but one might wonder about the first half!</p>
