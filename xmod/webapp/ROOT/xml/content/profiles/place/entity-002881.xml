      <head>Sanatorium Löw [Loew], Vienna</head>
      <div>

        <p>Private health clinic in Vienna IX, corner of the Mariannengasse and Pelikangasse, where
          many wealthy, well-known figures were treated and died. Schenker's health, in particular
          his diabetes, was managed there by the Director, <ref cRef="entity-000324">Dr. Julian
            Halberstam</ref>, between 1922 and 1935, and Schenker died there in January 1935.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>The Sanatorium</head>
        <p>The sanatorium was founded by Dr. Heinrich Löw in Vienna's 2nd district (Leopoldstadt) in
          1858, was continued in 1874 by his son Dr. Anton Loew, who in 1882 moved it to the 9th
          district (Alsergrund) at Mariannengasse 20, and who in the early 20th century developed it
          into the first Viennese clinic with surgical facilities, gradually enlarging it by taking
          over the surrounding houses as individual departments. Its nursing facilities were staffed
          by the Töchter des göttlichen Heilands. From 1907 it was led by Anton's daughter Gertrud
          Eisler von Terramare until its closure in 1938 by order of the Nazis. Those from the world
          of music who died there include <ref cRef="entity-000556">Gustav Mahler</ref> in 1911,
            <ref cRef="entity-000356">Emil Hertzka</ref> in 1932, and Schenker in 1935.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Sanatorium Löw and Schenker</head>
        <p>Schenker attended the sanatorium numerous times between 1922 and 1934 by way of
          outpatient appointments at which he consulted <ref cRef="entity-000324">Dr.
            Halberstam</ref>, with tests being taken by others. Schenker was admitted to the
          sanatorium as an in-patient in the early morning of Sunday January 13, 1935 for the
          administration of insulin, and died there at 1.30 a.m. the following day. A poignant
          account of Schenker's final illness and death is given by his <ref cRef="entity-000771"
            >wife</ref> in his diary, covering <ref type="diaries" cRef="OJ-04-08_1935-01:r0015"
            >January 4 to 14, 1935</ref>.</p>

        <p>The sister of Schenker's pupil <ref cRef="entity-000416">Marianne Kahn</ref>, <ref
            cRef="entity-006282">Trude Kahn</ref>, had a senior post at the sanatorium and was able
          on several occasions to act as a go-between for the Schenkers.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Correspondence</head>
        <p>No correspondence between the sanatorium and Schenker survives, but Schenker's diary
          attests that Schenker and <ref cRef="entity-000324">Halberstam</ref> corresponded
          frequently.</p>
