      <head>Tirol [Tyrol]</head>
      <div>

        <p>Region of Western Central Europe that includes the Austrian state of Tyrol (consisting of
          North Tyrol and East Tyrol), the capital city of which is Innsbruck, and the Italian
          region known as Trentino–Alto Adige/Südtirol (South Tyrol).</p>

        <p>As part of the Austrian Empire, the region was from 1867 onwards a crown land [<hi rend="italic">Kronland</hi>] of Cisleithania, the western half of
          Austria–Hungary. Under the St. Germain-en-Laye Treaty (September 10, 1919),
          Austria ceded South Tyrol to Italy.</p>

        <head>The Tyrol and Schenker</head>
        <p>In Schenker's day, the Tyrol was a favorite holiday region for the Viennese. Schenker
          spent most of his summer vacations (July–August) between 1903 and 1934 there,
          generally south and south-west of Innsbruck, as did many of his friends and pupils. So
          deeply attached was he to the South Tyrol and so strong were its cultural associations for him that after
          1919 he condemned any among his friends who continued to holiday there once the region had
          been ceded to Italy.</p>
