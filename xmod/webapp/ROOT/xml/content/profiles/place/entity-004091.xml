      <head>Podhajce (Pol.) [Pidhaitsi (Ukr.)]</head>
      <div>

        <p>Town formerly in <ref cRef="entity-002355">Galicia</ref>, now in Western Ukraine, 26km
          (16 miles) from Berezhany [<ref cRef="entity-002325">Brzeżani</ref>], 70km (44 miles) from
          Ternopil [Ternopol], and 100 km (62 miles) southeast of Lviv [<ref cRef="entity-002401"
            >Lemberg</ref>].</p>

        <p>Podhajce, which dates back to the middle ages, was located within southeastern <ref
            cRef="entity-002355">Galicia</ref>, which was part of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire from
          the late-17th century and an autonomous province of the Empire from 1873 until 1918, when
          it fell briefly within the boundaries of Western Ukraine. From 1921 until 1944 it lay
          within the Polish Republic. Podhajce's population in the late 19th century comprised
          largely Poles and Jews, the Jewish population (estimated at at least 40% of the town's
          populace) suffering extermination at the hands of the Nazis in 1941‒42.</p>

        <head>Podhajce and the Schenker family</head>
        <p><ref cRef="entity-000772">Johann</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000773">Julia Schenker</ref>
          moved from <ref cRef="entity-002333">Wisniowczyk</ref> (during which period their first
          five children were born) between 1868 and 1874 to Podhajce (where their last child, <ref
            cRef="entity-000774">Moriz</ref>, was born). Podhajce's remote location, surrounded by
          forest, may have made it susceptible to the chassidic and other movements. The town
          certainly had a strong orthodox contingent, and Johann, as an educated and
          Germanically-oriented member of the Jewish Enlightenment, would have kept the family
          independent of that influence. He studied medicine and served as the town medical doctor
            (<hi rend="italic">Stadtarzt</hi>) there until his death in 1887. Several death
          registrations in the town survive bearing his signature, and his service was sufficiently
          recognized for the town council, as Schenker's diary records, to name a street in his
          memory in Spring 1916. Birth records in Podhajce survive for three people with the last
          name Schenker, and some distant relationship to Johann's line may not be impossible.</p>

        <p><ref cRef="entity-000773">Julia</ref> left Podhajce for Vienna (where Heinrich had moved
          in 1884) soon after her <ref cRef="entity-000772">husband</ref>'s death, taking <ref
            cRef="entity-000319">Schifre</ref>, <ref cRef="entity-000774">Moriz</ref> and a niece
          with her. In 1914 there was some question of her returning to Podhajce, but she rejected
          the plan ("she would like neither to be with <ref cRef="entity-000319">Sophie</ref> nor to
          go to Podhajce" ‒ diary October 15, also October 17, 1914).</p>
