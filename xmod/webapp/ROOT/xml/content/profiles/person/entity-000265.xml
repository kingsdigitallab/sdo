      <head>Robert Fuchs</head>
      <div>

        <p>Austrian composer and teacher.</p>

          <head>Career Summary</head>
          <p>Robert Fuchs studied with his brother Johann Nepomuk Fuchs, moving to Vienna in 1865.
            He became organist at the Piaristenkirche in 1866, and studied composition at the
            Conservatory with Otto Dessoff, and himself became a professor of harmony, counterpoint,
            and composition at the Conservatory in 1874, continuing for thirty-seven years during
            which his many students included Ernst Decsey, Gustav Mahler, Jean Sibelius, Franz
            Schmidt, Franz Schreker, Hugo Wolf and Alexander von Zemlinsky. In 1912 he was forcibly
            pensioned off by the new administration along with Hermann Grädener to make way for "new
            blood" (<ref cRef="entity-000913">Moriz Violin</ref>'s outspoken pamphlet about the
            state of affairs at the Conservatory in 1912 contains a long section about this).</p>

          <p>His works include two operas, five symphonies, five serenades and other orchestral
            works, a large amount of chamber music including piano quartets and trios, string
            quartets and trios, violin sonatas, cello sonatas, piano sonatas, also many choral works
            and collections of solo songs.</p>

        <div>
          <head>Fuchs and Schenker</head>
          <p>Brahms thought very highly of Fuchs, and that ‒ along with Violin's admiration ‒
            probably endeared him to Schenker. And yet in 1907 he commented that an orchestral
            serenade by Fuchs was "very short-breathed and spiritually too primitively shaped" (OJ
            1/6, p. 32).</p>
