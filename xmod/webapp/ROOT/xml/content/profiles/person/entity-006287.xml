        <p>German soprano.</p>

        <p>Marie Schoder took vocal studies at the Grand Ducal Music School in Weimar in the 1880s.
          She was a member of the Weimar Court Opera between 1891 and 1900. In 1899 she married the
          conductor of the Weimar Court Theater, <ref cRef="entity-003007">Gustav Gutheil</ref>. In
          1900 she was invited by Gustav Mahler to join the Vienna Court Opera, and continued to
          work there until 1927. After retirement from singing, she pursued a teaching career in
          Vienna and at the Salzburg Mozarteum.</p>

        <p>In addition to singing leading roles in operas such as <title level="m">Carmen</title>,
            <title level="m">Faust</title>, and <title level="m">Mignon</title>, and also in operas
          by Mozart, she pioneered roles in contemporary operas such as <title level="m"
            >Salome</title>, <title level="m">Elektra</title>, <title level="m">Der
            Rosenkavalier</title> (Oktavian), and <title level="m">Die Frau ohne Schatten</title> by
          Richard Strauss, with whom she studied these roles. She also sang the soprano part in the
          third and fourth movements ("Litanei" and "Entrückung") of <ref cRef="entity-000798"
            >Schoenberg</ref>'s Second String Quartet, Op. 10 (December 1908) at its first
          performance with the <ref cRef="entity-000727">Rosé Quartet</ref>, and also at the
          première of the latter's monodrama <title level="m">Erwartung</title> (1909) in Prague in
          June 1924.</p>
