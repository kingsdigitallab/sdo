      <head>Daniel de Lange</head>
      <div>

        <p>Dutch composer, teacher and writer on music, the son of <ref cRef="entity-000509">Samuel
            de Lange</ref>.</p>

        <div>
          <head>Career Summary</head>
          <p>Lange studied cello (A. F. Servais) and composition (Berthold Damcke) at the Brussels
            Conservatory, thereafter touring as a soloist. He taught at the <ref
              cRef="entity-002401">Lemberg</ref> (L'viv) Conservatory in the period 1860‒62, then at
            the Toonkunst school in Rotterdam from 1862. He lived and worked in Paris 1864‒70 until
            the Franco-Prussian war forced him to move to Amsterdam, where he established a music
            school at Zaandam in 1873. In 1884 he co-founded the <ref cRef="entity-006181">Amsterdam
              Conservatory</ref> with Frans Coenen, teaching there and serving as its director
            1895‒1913. In 1914 he moved to Pont Loma in California. He was an important early
            champion of music of the Renaissance, and he worked as a music critic from 1875 to
            1913.</p>

        <div>
          <head>Lange and Schenker</head>
          <p>There is no surviving correspondence between the two men, nor is any personal contact
            known. In 1908, Schenker wrote that Lange had a copy of the first edition of <ref
              cRef="entity-001721"><title level="m">Beitrag zur Ornamentik</title></ref>, and that
            he "views my work favorably"; a copy of the second edition was sent to him at Schenker's
            instruction (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="WSLB-21">WSLB 21</ref>, <ref
              type="correspondence" cRef="OC-52-27">OC 52/27</ref>, <ref type="correspondence"
              cRef="WSLB-22">WSLB 22</ref>). Schenker was conscious of the <ref cRef="entity-006181"
              >Amsterdam Conservatory</ref>, where his friends <ref cRef="entity-000724">Julius
              Röntgen</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000592">Johannes Messchaert</ref> taught, as a
            potential place for advocacy of his theories.</p>
