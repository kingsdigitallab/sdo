      <head>Hugo Knepler</head>

        <p>Viennese music dealer, music publisher, and concert management agency.</p>

        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Hugo Knepler was the proprietor of a sheet music retail company 1905‒07, and thereafter
          managing director of the sheet music retailer and concert agency <ref cRef="entity-002456"
            >Albert J. Gutmann</ref>, and after Gutmann's death the firm's proprietor. Between 1916
          and 1927 he took over also the proprietorship of his brother Paul's publishing house,
          Verlag Paul Knepler (Wallishauser Buchhandlung).</p>

        <p>In 1939 he emigrated to France, but fell into German hands, was deported to Auschwitz on
          April 13, 1944, where he died.</p>

        <head>Knepler and Schenker</head>
        <p>There is no known correspondence or direct contact between the two men. His name is
          invoked several times in correspondence between Schenker and <ref cRef="entity-000356"
            >Emil Hertzka</ref> (<ref cRef="entity-002408">Universal Edition</ref>) when Schenker
          was attempting to form a protective organization of composers and performers. In one
          letter (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="WSLB-133">WSLB 133</ref>, August 26, 1912)
          Schenker remarks that he was someone “who considers the time has come for even musicians
          at last to unite to protect their interests against those of Knepler, perhaps even against
          journalists.” He thus saw Knepler as, in his agency business, taking advantage of
          musicians.</p>

        <p>Knepler is mentioned by Angi Elias in a letter to Schenker (<ref type="correspondence"
            cRef="OC-52-631">OC 52/631</ref>, July 13, 1925) as having mistakenly supplied her with
          two subscriptions to <ref cRef="entity-001793"><title level="j">Der
          Tonwille</title></ref>.</p>
