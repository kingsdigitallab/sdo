        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>One of the leading violinists of his age, Rosé began his career with studies at the
          Vienna Conservatory under Carl Heißler (1874-77). After four years spent on tour as a
          soloist, Rosé was appointed concertmaster of the Vienna Hofoper (where he worked closely
          with Gustav Mahler, to whom he was related by marriage, during the latter's directorship)
          and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras in 1881, remaining until 1938, and was also
          concertmaster at Bayreuth 1888-96. In 1882, he founded the Rosé Quartet with his brother
            <ref cRef="entity-000728">Eduard</ref>, a cellist. Later, Rosé taught violin at the
          Vienna Conservatory from 1893 to 1901 (when he left in protest against the introduction of
          the Meisterklassen) and 1908-18 (Tittel; <title level="m">MGG</title>: 1908-1924). In 1938
          he moved to England.</p>

        <head>The Rosé String Quartet</head>
        <p>The Quartet was one of the leading chamber ensembles in Europe. It gave many first
          performances, notably of works by Brahms, Pfitzner, Korngold, Reger, Schoenberg, and
          Webern. These included the premières of Schoenberg's First String Quartet, Op.7 (February
          5, 1907) and First Chamber Symphony, Op.9 (February 8, 1907), both of which Schenker
          attended (Schoenberg having drawn his attention to them), commenting caustically in his
          diary, and his Second String Quartet, Op.10 (December 1908).</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Rosé and Schenker</head>
        <p>Rosé's and his quartet's commitment to the German/Austrian Classical repertory and its
          personal association with Brahms disposed Schenker favorably to them in the 1890s (see
          early reviews: Federhofer (1990)); however, their increasing advocacy of new music aroused
          his disapproval. In 1908, he described Rosé's playing as "oppressed by the dark and somber
          power of school pedantry, ungainly and monotonous, lacking color and warmth, like a nag in
          harness that sits and broods, waiting dully for the coachman's signal." (OJ 1/7, pp.
          80-81: February 28, 1908).</p>
        <p>There is no known correspondence between Schenker and Rosé. He is mentioned frequently in
          correspondence with others, in Schenker's diaries and lessonbooks.</p>
