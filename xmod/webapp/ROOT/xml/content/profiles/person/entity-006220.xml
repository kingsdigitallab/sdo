        <head>Career summary</head>
        <p>Regine Klein began her career as a soprano soloist at the Carl Theater and Comic Opera
          (Ringtheater) in Vienna 1875–82, but then redirected her career to focus on serious roles
          at the Prague Opera 1882–84 and Vienna Court Opera 1885–87, where she was much loved by
          audiences, her farewell performance on May 28, 1887 being in the role of Senta in Wagner’s
            <title level="m">Flying Dutchman</title>. In 1899, she and her mother were victims of a
          highway robbery while travelling in winter in a sled at night.</p>

        <p>In 1887 she married the wealthy banker Gustav Heine-Geldern, nephew of <ref
            cRef="entity-000348">Heinrich Heine</ref> (1797–1856), becoming the possessor of the
          poet’s papers and manuscripts at her husband’s death in 1898. She continued to sing at
          charitable events, to the committees of which she devoted much of her life, as she did
          also to playing competitive golf.</p>

        <head>Baronin Heine and Schenker</head>
        <p>Baronin Heine had been taking lessons with Schenker during 1906/07, and possibly before
          that. Schenker's diary records that she failed to turn up for lessons in October 1907.</p>
