      <head>Erich Kornfeld</head>

      <div>
        <p>Son of <ref cRef="entity-000466">Emil</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jenny
            Kornfeld</ref> (<hi rend="italic">née</hi> Schiff; later <ref cRef="entity-000771"
            >Jeanette Schenker</ref>); business man.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Erich Kornfeld was the elder son of <ref cRef="entity-000466">Emil</ref> and <ref
            cRef="entity-000771">Jenny Kornfeld</ref>. He had one sibling, <ref cRef="entity-000468"
            >Felix</ref>. After Jenny's departure from the family home (Dresdenerstraße 8, Aussig:
            <ref type="correspondence" cRef="CA-127">CA 127</ref>, September 20, 1910) in September
          1910, there was apparently no contact between Erich and his mother, under strict
          injunction from <ref cRef="entity-000466">Emil</ref>. <ref cRef="entity-000469">Tomáš
            Kornfeld</ref> stated in 1988:<cit>

            <q>This separation was total; all contacts with the family were broken off; [Jenny] was
              so to speak taboo for her husband Emil, and sons. Emil and Erich never again had any
              contact with her."</q>
          </cit></p>

        <p>In 1914 Erich joined a regiment (Schenker's diary, August 1, 1914), and Jenny made
          several appeals for information about his service in World War I, as a result of which she
          acquired his address (diary, October 7, 1914). Schenker's diary also records that Jeanette
          heard from her sister <ref cRef="entity-003244">Klara Hatschek</ref> (<hi rend="italic"
            >née</hi> Schiff) on May 9, 1932: "(long letter): all sorts of things – [...] concerning
          the Weils, Erich, and Felix."</p>

        <p>Erich and <ref cRef="entity-000468">Felix</ref> both worked in their father's company,
          Klaber &amp; Kornfeld, traders in petroleum, oil, and grease for industrial purposes.
          After <ref cRef="entity-000466">Emil</ref>'s death in 1937, the two continued the work of
          the firm, which had however been running into difficulties for some years and ceased
          trading soon afterward (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-14-7_1">OJ 14/ 7, [1]</ref>
          and <ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-71-12a_2">OJ 71/21a, [2]</ref>).</p>

        <p>Erich married Marianne Öttl (1906‒) on March 21, 1925 in <ref cRef="entity-002482">Ústí
            nad Labem (Aussig)</ref> (on their marriage certificate, under religion Marianne gave
          “evangelical,” Erich “of no religion”), and the couple had two children: Peter, born March
          30, 1932, and Charlotte, born July 19, 1944, both in <ref cRef="entity-002482">Ústí nad
            Labem</ref>. In a letter of 1934, <ref cRef="entity-000944">Rosa Weil</ref> gave her
          elder sister <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette</ref> the following report (<ref
            type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-14-10_15">OJ 14/10, [15]</ref>): <cit>
            <q>Your sons both have pretty, likeable wives (non-Jews), and each has one splendid
              child: Erich has Peter, <ref cRef="entity-000468">Felix</ref> has <ref
                cRef="entity-000469">Tommy</ref>. Erich’s wife is an Öttl, who was at one time in
              school with <ref cRef="entity-005248">Lene</ref> – not that they are friends, since
                <ref cRef="entity-005248">Lene</ref> has, alas, scarcely been in <ref
                cRef="entity-002482">Aussig</ref> for years.</q>
          </cit>
        </p>

        <p>A letter from the period 1940‒41 from Jenny (by this time Jeanette Schenker) to his
          brother <ref cRef="entity-000468">Felix</ref>, quoted in a letter by grandson Tomáš
          Kornfeld (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-71-12a_2">OJ 71/12a, [2]</ref>, June 7,
          1988) refers to Erich as having "long been of an age to understand a fateful passion [i.e.
          that which drew Jenny away from her family] and to come down from his lofty seat of
          judgment."</p>

        <p>As Jews, Erich and <ref cRef="entity-000468">Felix</ref> were both arrested by the
          Gestapo on November 10, 1938 and taken to a concentration camp. Erich was released after
          six weeks on grounds that he was a "casualty and hero of the [first world] war," or as
            <ref cRef="entity-000468">Felix</ref> recorded it a "front-line soldier" (<ref
            type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-14-7_1">OJ 14/7, [1]</ref>, August 23, 1939). As Germans,
          Erich, Marianne and the children were driven out of Czechoslovakia after World War II, and
          settled at Holbeinstrasse 7, Rosenheim-Kahltmühl, in Upper Bavaria. Erich died on or
          around 1965. Peter was a pharmacist.</p>

        <head>Correspondence</head>
        <p>No direct correspondence between Heinrich Schenker and Erich is known to have existed.
          Tomáš Kornfeld quoted (in <ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-71-12a_2">OJ 71/12a,
            [2]</ref>, June 7, 1988) from one postcard written by Erich to Emil while evidently on
          summer vacation: "Lots and lots of kisses, Papa ‒ greetings from H. Schenker – Greetings,
          Erich." No date is given for the postcard, and its survival since 1988 is unknown. The
          postcard does suggest that Heinrich knew Erich and Felix through holidaying with them
          between 1903 (when they were 8 and 4 respectively) and 1910. An informative letter from
          Felix Kornfeld to his mother dated August 23, 1939 (<ref type="correspondence"
            cRef="OJ-14-7_1">OJ 14/7, [1]</ref>) reports incidentally on Erich's situation at that
          time, and the strained relationship between the two siblings.</p>
