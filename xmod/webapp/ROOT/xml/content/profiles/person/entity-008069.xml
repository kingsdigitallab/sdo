      <head>Reisel Szalit [Schalit] née Bressler</head>
      <div>

        <p>Mother of pianist <ref cRef="entity-000878">Paula Szalit</ref>.</p>

        <p>Reisel Szalit and her husband <ref cRef="entity-008068">Simon</ref> had four children:
          Beile (1866–), <ref cRef="entity-007722">Heinrich</ref> (1867–), Rebeca (1871–), and <ref
            cRef="entity-000878">Paula</ref> (1885–1942). Of these, Heinrich and Paula are known
          both to have been musically gifted.</p>

        <p>Nothing is known of the relationship between Reisel and Paula after the latter left home
          for Vienna c. 1893. Schenker’s diary for June 18, 1914 records: “Paula Szalit's mother
          visits me for the first time and informs me of the dreadful tragedy that her daughter has
          been stricken by religious mania.” Schenker’s callous reaction was: “Who may have sent her
          mother to me? Who, in view of the tragedy, had the depravity to spare themselves expenses
          only to pile them upon me, who had not seen the girl since she was fourteen or fifteen
          years old?” This is the only known contact between Reisel Szalit and Heinrich
          Schenker.</p>

        <p><ref cRef="entity-000878">Paula</ref> herself wrote to Schenker in 1918 that she was
          entirely “cut off” from her family. This suggests that a rift had taken place somewhere
          between 1906, when she returned to <ref cRef="entity-002401">Lemberg</ref> as head of the
          advanced piano class at the Lemberg Conservatory, at which point her performing career
          appears to have stopped, and some time in the mid-1910s.</p>
