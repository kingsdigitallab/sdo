      <head>Paul Stefan [Stephan]</head>
      <p>Austrian writer on music.</p>

      <div>
        <p>Paul Stefan lived in Vienna from 1898, taking a doctorate in law in 1904 and studying
          music theory with Hermann Grädener and Arnold Schoenberg. He became a music critic,
          strongly advocating modern music, and played a leading role in the <ref
            cRef="entity-003006">Ansorge-Verein</ref> in 1903. From 1922 to 1938 he was editor and a
          major contributor to <ref cRef="entity-002555"><title level="j">Musikblätter des
              Anbruch</title></ref>. In 1922, he was one of the founders of the International
          Society for New Music, and served as the vice-president for its Austrian section. </p>

        <p>In 1938, he emigrated via Switzerland and Portugal (1938‒41) to the USA, where he was
          correspondent to several newspapers and periodicals. He wrote many books on composers
          (Mahler, Schubert, Dvořák, and Bizet), conductors (Toscanini, Bruno Walter) and musical
          subjects (e.g. Viennese opera). </p>

      <div>
        <head>Stefan and Schenker</head>
        <p>There seems to have been no contact or correspondence between the two men, but Schenker
          was aware of him as a moving force in the world of Viennese modern music and referred to
          him occasionally in his diaries. </p>
