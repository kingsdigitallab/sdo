      <head>Andrew Carnegie</head>
      <div>

        <p>Scottish-born iron and steel magnate in the United States, philanthropist on a scale
          unprecedented for his time, who founded libraries, donated to schools and universities,
          established institutions, and supported the arts. He built Carnegie Hall in New York City
          and founded Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburg. He is said to have given away over
          $350M in his lifetime and another $100M in his will.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Mellon and Schenker</head>
        <p>Schenker mentions him in his diary and correspondence, referring to him as "this
          multimillion-dollar scoundrel" and as having "so little gray matter in his head" (<ref
            type="diaries" cRef="OJ-01-15_1914-08:r0031">diary, August 23, 1914</ref>). In a letter
          of gratitude to his first great patron, <ref cRef="entity-000743">Alphons von
            Rothschild</ref>, he said that Alphons had "bequeathed the world a finer gift with your
          support of [my] books than did a Carnegie with his millions" (<ref type="correspondence"
            cRef="OJ-5-34_1">OJ 5/34, [1]</ref>, March 2, 1911). In a short essay entitled "The
          Charitable Deeds of American Billionaires," Schenker commented that it is a crime to be as
          rich as Carnegie was (<ref type="diaries" cRef="OJ-01-10_1911-11:r0005">diary, November
            17, 1911</ref>). </p>
