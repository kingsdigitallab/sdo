        <p>Austrian composer, conductor, composition teacher, and music educator.</p>

        <head>Career Summary</head>
        
        <p>Schreker studied violin (Bachrich and Rosé) and composition (Fuchs) at the
          Vienna Conservatory (1892-1900). Having established himself as a conductor and achieved
          success as a composer, especially with the sensational premiere of his opera 
            <title level="m">Der ferne Klang</title> in 1910, he taught music theory and composition at
          the Vienna Conservatory 1912-20, and was then appointed Director of the Berlin Hochschule
          für Musik in 1920, holding that post until, as a Jew, he was removed by the Nazi
          regime in 1932. He was a distinguished and highly influential composition teacher, his
          pupils including Berthold Goldschmidt, Alois Hába, and Ernst Krenek.</p>
        
        <p>His musical style was characterized by "aesthetic plurality (a mixture of Romanticism,
          naturalism, symbolism, Impressionism, Expressionism and Neue Sachlichkeit)" (C. Hailey,
            <title level="m">NGDM2</title>), as well as by sensitive use of tone-color. He composed
          orchestral works (notably his <title level="m">Kammersymphonie</title> (1916)), choral
          works, and Lieder, but his principal achievement lay in composing operas, principal among
          which were:</p>

        </p>
        
        <p>Having signed a contract with <ref cRef="entity-002408">Universal Edition</ref> in 1909, Schreker became one of that
          publisher's most important and highly promoted composers, achieving great international
          success, which, however, waned after 1923.</p>

          <head>Schreker and Schenker</head>
        
        <p>Schenker, whose principal publisher was UE also, probably resented the high level of
          publicity given to Schreker (as also to Korngold and others) by UE's Director, <ref cRef="entity-000356">Emil
          Hertzka</ref>, comparing it with what he saw as excessively modest publicity for his own works.
          As a composer of "modern" music, Schreker was no doubt in Schenker's eyes a contributor to
          what he considered the downfall of music.</p>
          
        <p>There is no known correspondence between Schreker and Schenker.</p>
