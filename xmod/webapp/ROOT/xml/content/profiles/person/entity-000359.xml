      <div>
        <p>Music publisher, head of the firm of <ref cRef="entity-004002">Ludwig Doblinger</ref>,
          shareholder in <ref cRef="entity-002408">Universal Edition</ref>.</p>

        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Herzmansky, who began his business career in the textile industry, acquired the music
          publishing house of <ref cRef="entity-004002">Ludwig Doblinger</ref> (Vienna I,
          Dorotheergasse 10 ‒ the former Palais Dietrichstein) in 1876 and built it up to be one of
          Vienna's leading music dealers, specializing in sheet music, antiquarian music, music
          hire, and instructional books. The firm published a wide range of musical repertory,
          making much of its money from the publication of Viennese operetta. He was a co-founder of
          the Gesellschaft der Autoren, Komponisten und Musikverleger (AKM) (Society of Authors,
          Composers, and Music Publishers) in 1897, of which <ref cRef="entity-000946">Josef
            Weinberger</ref> was elected President.</p>

        <p>In 1901, he joined with <ref cRef="entity-000946">Weinberger</ref>, <ref
            cRef="entity-000720">Adolf Robitschek</ref>, and Carl Stampfel, to form the
          collaborative venture of <ref cRef="entity-002408">Universal Edition</ref>. (Apparently
          discussions had been going on among these men since 1896 to mount an Austrian challenge to
          the hegemony of Peters Edition and Breitkopf &amp; Härtel in Germany.) UE's catalogue was
          built in part by acquisitions from Doblinger and other music publishers. Weinberger,
          Robitschek, and Herzmansky, all based in Vienna and all highly experienced music
          publishers, took on the day-to-day running of the new house in its early years, until <ref
            cRef="entity-000356">Emil Hertzka</ref> joined the firm in 1907. </p>

        <head>Herzmansky and Schenker</head>
        <p>In 1892, Schenker's <title>Zwei Klavierstücke</title>, Op. 1 were published by Doblinger;
          and in 1906 Schenker had a verbal agreement with Doblinger and Eberle to publish what
          later became his <ref cRef="entity-001729"><title level="m"
            >Instrumenten-Tabelle</title></ref>, published by UE in 1908. His dealings over the
          latter were not with Herzmansky but with <ref cRef="entity-000875">Josef Stritzko</ref>.
          Schenker received at least one letter from UE with Herzmansky as co-signatory (OC 52/391,
          June 20, 1904).</p>
