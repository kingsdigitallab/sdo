        <p>German music teacher and composer. </p>

        <p>Schmid was trained as a school teacher, with specialty in music, at the Esslingen and
          Nürtingen teachers' colleges (1890‒95). He held various teaching posts in the Stuttgart
          region from 1895‒1903 before meeting <ref cRef="entity-000326">August Halm</ref> and
          following him to Hermann Lietz's Haubinda country boarding school. There, he taught with
          and learned from Halm for three months. After a sabbatical to advance his music studies,
          he held several more teaching posts, beginning in 1906, before taking a position at the
          Nagold teachers' college in 1912, from which he retired in March, 1938. </p>

        <p>Schmid corresponded regularly with Halm from 1903 until Halm's death in 1929, and modeled
          his teaching and compositions on Halm's example.</p>
