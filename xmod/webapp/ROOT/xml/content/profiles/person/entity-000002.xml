      <head>Friedrich Adler</head>
      <div>

        <p>Austrian politician, member of the Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAP), of which his
          father <ref cRef="entity-000005">Victor Adler</ref> was the founder.</p>

        <p>In 1916, as party secretary, he shot dead the Austrian Minister-President <ref
            cRef="entity-000877">Karl Stürgkh</ref>, was condemned to death but was pardoned by
          Emperor Karl I in 1918, and became a popular hero among socialists and communists. From
          1923 to 1940, he was General Secretary of the Socialist Worker's International. Between
          1938 and 1945, he played an important part in the alignment of the exiled organization of
          the Austrian Socialists (AVOES). After 1945, he was in the political wilderness on account
          of his German nationalist views.</p>
