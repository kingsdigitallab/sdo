      <head>Ernst Kunwald</head>

      <p>Austrian conductor.</p>

      <div>
        <head>Career summary</head>
        <p>Kunwald studied law at the University of Vienna, taking a Dr. Juris in 1891. He studied
          piano with Leschetizky and composition with <ref cRef="entity-000301">Hermann
            Graedener</ref> at the Vienna Conservatory, then with Salomon Jadassohn at the Leipzig
          Conservatory.</p>

        <p>From 1895 he held conducting positions in a succession of cities leading to that of
          second conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic 1907‒12, after which he was conductor of the
          Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra 1912‒17, in succession to Stokowski. While in the USA he was
          interned as an enemy alien and deported, after which he was general music director in
          Königsberg 1920‒27, then principal conductor of the Berlin Symphony 1928‒32. From 1933 to
          his death in 1939 he lived in Vienna.</p>

        <p>He wrote a textbook on conducting (unpublished), and several published articles.</p>

        <head>Kunwald and Schenker</head>
        <p>The two men were personally acquainted. Kunwald is first mentioned in Schenker's diary on
          April 9, 1907 in the company of <ref cRef="entity-000925">Fritz Wahle</ref> and <ref
            cRef="entity-000913">Moriz Violin</ref> in a coffee-house in a discussion of Brahms's
          epigonism, in which Kunwald is presented as somewhat naive (OJ 1/6, p. 37). Kunwald
          further figures in the entry for November 11, 1911 (OJ 1/10, p. 185): an "altogether naive
          article" by him on the Ninth Symphony prompts Schenker to retell the story of the
          epigonism discussion in greater detail.</p>
