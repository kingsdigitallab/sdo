      <head>Emil Kornfeld</head>
      <div>
        <p>First husband of <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette Schenker</ref>.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Son of Ignatz Kornfeld (1831‒92) and Charlotte Weissenstein (1836‒1919), Emil lived first
          in Luže (district Vysoké Myto), and from 1892 in <ref cRef="entity-002248">Aussig (Ústí
            nad Labem)</ref>. He had two siblings, Clara and Friedrich.</p>

        <p>Emil married <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jenny Schiff</ref> on July 30, 1893, and the
          couple had two sons, <ref cRef="entity-000467">Erich</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000468"
            >Felix</ref>.</p>

        <p>Emil was a business man, his firm being a chemical company trading in petroleum, oil, and
          grease for industrial purposes; both sons were involved in it, and possibly Jenny, too, in
          a secretarial capacity up to 1910. A page survives in Schenker's diary (OJ 1/10, p. 133
            <hi rend="italic">verso</hi>, June 1911), with the printed letterhead: <cit>
            <q>Klaber &amp; Kornfeld | Aussig A. E. | - | Telegramm-Addresse | Klaber Kornfeld
              Aussig | Telefon No. 103 | Clearing-Verkehr: Ceck-Conto No. 27.999. | - |</q>
          </cit></p>

        <p>Emil died in Aussig on February 2, 1937.</p>

        <head>Emil Kornfeld, Jenny Kornfeld, and Heinrich Schenker</head>
        <p>Emil and Heinrich were apparently close friends from some time in the early 1890s to 1910
          (the origin of this friendship is still unknown), and between 1903 and 1908 they spent
          several summer holidays together, probably (certainly in 1908) including Jenny.</p>

        <p>Jenny and Heinrich spent part of the summer of 1910 together on vacation in the
          Karerpass, Tyrol, and evidence of their relationship during those weeks can be found in
          his correspondence with <ref cRef="entity-000913">Moriz Violin</ref>. Jenny then returned
          to Aussig, but left her husband and sons for Schenker in late September 1910, arriving
          Vienna on September 30. From that time all mention of her in the Kornfeld family was
          forbidden by Emil, although Jenny is known to have made attempts to contact her sons (<ref
            type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-71-21a_2">OJ 71/21a, [2]</ref>). Emil resisted petitions
          for separation on the part of Jenny for nearly seven years (the attorneys being Dr.
          Steinitz, Dr. Hübsch, and Dr. Glässner), insisting that Jenny return to him, and the
          approval of their divorce was not granted until July 31, 1919. Only after further
          obstacles had been overcome, and after changes in the law on remarriage in Austria, were
          Jenny and Heinrich married in Vienna on November 10, 1919. Emil never remarried.</p>

        <head>Correspondence</head>
        <p>No correspondence between Emil Kornfeld and Schenker is known to survive. However, one
          postcard exists among Schenker's papers: a picture postcard from Jenny Kornfeld to Moriz
          Violin, dated September 23, 1909 (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-7-4_54">OJ 7/4,
            [54]</ref>), which includes a postscript apparently in the hand of Emil. In Schenker's
          post-1910 diaries Emil's name is coded as "Kfld." (Kornfeld) or "der Krämer" (the grocer)
          or "der Gegner" (the adversary).</p>
