        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>The Waldeck family name was originally Dzyjivenetnik. Upon emigration to America,
          Arthur's parents changed it to "Waldeck," borrowing the name from the famous French Prime
          Minister, Ren√© Waldeck-Rousseau (1864-1904), who settled the Dreyfus Affair and legalized
          trade unions (1884). Arthur's son, Lewis Waldeck, later remembered his paternal
          grandmother, an amateur violinist, fondly as "an old Viennese anarchist." Taking after his
          mother in his political associations, Arthur was a "Lovestoneite" in the 1930s (after Jay
          Lovestone [1897-1990], one of the founders of the American Communist Party). It was during
          this time that he made a living as an accounting clerk for a fur importer while studying
          Schenker's works; his wife, Ellie, was a grade-school teacher. While Waldeck's family
          background had prepared him well in Schenker's culture and language, his politics were at
          the opposite end of the spectrum; fortunately, that subject never came up in their
          correspondence.</p>
        <p>Later, Waldeck was active as a voice teacher, having maintained a studio in Carnegie Hall
          in the 1940s and 50s. As a voice teacher, he was gentle and supportive, but he is also
          remembered as a "systems man" in his early years, who at times could be inflexible in his
          later teaching. Two of his articles on vocal pedagogy, "Excellent Singing" (1953) and
          "Voice and Voice Training" (1960) are also in the Mannes Collection.</p>

        <head>Waldeck and Schenker</head>
        <p>Waldeck was one of the pioneers of Schenker studies in America, who completed the first
          translation into English of Schenker's <ref cRef="entity-001724"><title level="m"
              >Harmonielehre</title></ref>, and translated portions of <ref cRef="entity-001725"
              ><title level="m">Kontrapunkt</title></ref> and <ref cRef="entity-001728"><title
              level="m">Der freie Satz</title></ref>. It was his translation of <ref
            cRef="entity-001724"><title level="m">Harmonielehre</title></ref> that formed the body
          of Oswald Jonas's project when it was accepted for publication by the University of
          Chicago Press in May of 1952. (The translation by Elisabeth Mann Borgese eventually
          replaced it as a result of criticism of the project by pre-publication reviewers.)</p>

        <p>Waldeck attended at least one seminar taught by <ref cRef="entity-000951">Hans
            Weisse</ref> (attended also by <ref cRef="entity-000102">Nathan Broder</ref>), and he
          also studied Schenker's work with the composer <ref cRef="entity-000131">Israel
            Citkowitz</ref>. Waldeck's personal library of Schenker's works, nearly complete and
          covered with copious marginalia in shorthand, demonstrates prolonged and serious
          engagement with Schenker's works. Two typescript copies of his 419-page translation of
            <ref cRef="entity-001724"><title level="m">Harmonielehre</title></ref> are also in this
          collection. All these materials were preserved at the library of the Mannes School of
          Music, and are now held in the Archives &amp; Special Collections library of The New
          School, New York, NY 10016, as MP.0008.01, boxes 1 and 2.</p>
