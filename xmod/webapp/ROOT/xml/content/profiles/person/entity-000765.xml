      <head>Philipp Scheidemann</head>
      <div>

        <p>German Social Democrat politician; second Chancellor of the Weimar Republic. </p>

        <p>During World War I, Scheidemann was co-leader with Friedrich Ebert of the majority
          faction of the Social Democratic Party (MSPD). In June 1918, he became vice-president of
          the Reichstag, and joined the cabinet in the October. </p>

        <p>On November 9, 1918, the first day of the general strike, and under threat of a workers'
          revolution, it was Scheidemann who from a window of the Reichstag unilaterally announced
          to an enormous crowd that Ebert had taken over the chancellorship, and proclaimed "Long
          live the great German Republic!" (to the fury of Ebert). (Two hours later, a "Free
          Socialist Republic" was announced by <ref cRef="entity-003137">Karl Liebknecht</ref>.)
          Later that day Emperor Wilhelm II abdicated. Thereafter, Scheidemann served as a leader in
          the provisional government until in February 1919 at a national assembly in Weimar Ebert
          became President. Scheidemann was then appointed Chancellor, but resigned in the June over
          issues concerning the Versailles Treaty. He went into exile following the rise of the Nazi
          Party in 1933. </p>
