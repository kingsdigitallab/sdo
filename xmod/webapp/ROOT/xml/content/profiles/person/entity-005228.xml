        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Steuermann studied with <ref cRef="entity-000116">Busoni</ref> in Berlin and with <ref
            cRef="entity-000798">Arnold Schoenberg</ref>. In 1912 he played in the first performance
          of Schoenberg's <title level="m">Pierrot lunaire</title>, and after that in every one of
          his first performances involving piano. He also premiered <ref cRef="entity-000061">Alban
            Berg</ref>'s <title>Piano Sonata</title> and <title>Chamber Concerto</title>, and most
          of <ref cRef="entity-003019">Anton Webern</ref>'s chamber music with piano, and much other
          contemporary music, while also playing the standard repertory, notably Beethoven. From
          1919 to 1936 he lived in Vienna. He taught at the Paderewski School in L'viv, and later at
          the Jewish Conservatory of Kraków (1932‒36). </p>

        <p>He emigrated to the USA in 1938 and settled in New York, teaching at the Philadelphia
          Conservatory, and at the Juilliard School 1952‒64, while also performing internationally.
          His pupils in America included Alfred Brendel, Moura Lympany, Menahem Pressler, composer
          Gunther Schuller, and theorists Edward T. Cone and David Lewin.</p>

        <head>Steuermann and Schenker</head>
        <p>The two men were evidently acquainted, though Steuermann is only twice mentioned in
          Schenker's diary, his playing in Mozart, Schumann, and Beethoven four-hands pieces
          described as "Without any zest; not even the performance indications specified by the
          composer were observed!" (February 23, 1930). He is once mentioned by <ref
            cRef="entity-000913"> Moriz Violin</ref> in a letter to <ref cRef="entity-000798"
            >Schoenberg</ref> (LC ASC 27/45, [27], April 14, 1941).</p>
