      <head>Gustav Stresemann</head>
      <div>

        <p>German politician, served as Chancellor (1923) and Foreign Minister (1923â€’29) during the
          Weimar Republic. </p>

        <p>Initially associated with the left wing of the National Liberals, Stresemann moved to the
          right during World War I, espousing monarchist and expansionist views. He formed the
          German People's Party (DVP), hostile to the Marxists. In August 1923, during the Ruhr
          crisis, he was appointed Chancellor and Foreign Minister of a grand coalition government
          within the Weimar Republic. </p>

        <p>Stresemann argued for trying to fulfill Germany's obligations under the Versailles Treaty
          as far as possible. He negotiated the Dawes Plan of 1924, involving a loan from the USA,
          the Locarno Treaties of 1925 with Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium, and the Treaty of
          Berlin of 1926, in which year Germany was admitted a permanent member of the Security
          Council of the League of Nations. He forged strong links with the USA. He was awarded the
          Nobel Peace Prize for 1926 together with Aristide Briand. </p>
