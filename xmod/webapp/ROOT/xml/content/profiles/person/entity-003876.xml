      <head>Richard Teschner</head>

      <p>Painter, graphic artist, sculptor, and puppet master.</p>

        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Richard Teschner studied at the Kunstakademie in Prague (1896‒99) and between 1908 and
          1912 was associated with Klimt, Josef Hoffmann and the Wiener Werkstätte. From 1912 he
          worked with puppetry, fashioning the puppets and creating the staging himself and even
          composing his own music, often using the "Polyphon" ‒ a large musical box with
          interchangeable metal disks.</p>

        <p>One of the greatest representatives of the Gesamtkunstwerk on a miniaturist scale,
          Richard Teschner was a universalist like many other artists who came to Vienna from
          Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia (e.g. Gustav Mahler, Josef Hoffmann, Alfred Roller, Joseph
          Maria Olbrich). Although his work was regarded as part of the Jugendstil movement, the
          world of imagery that he created was inspired by the Javanese art of stick puppetry (<hi
            rend="italic">Wayang kulit</hi>).</p>

        <p>Heinrich and Jeanette Schenker purchased tickets at 10 shillings for the Teschner
          "Figurentheater" performance on January 28, 1928 their delight at which Heinrich recorded
          in his diary (OJ 4/1, p. 3170): <cit>
            <q>5:15 to Gersthof, to Teschner; we are both utterly enchanted by the presentation, in
              particular I was astounded by the ballerina's good ear; she danced better than
              Wiesenthal. Weber's <title level="m">Invitation to the Dance</title> was the subject,
              the "Christmas Play" was thoroughly beautiful, the pictures and colors impressive. I
              especially liked the figure of St. Joseph, my Lie-Liechen the Annunciation and the
              Angel; she even saw jewels on the fingers of the Three Kings.</q>
          </cit></p>

        <p>Teschner's surviving effects are now preserved in the Theatermuseum in Vienna (part of
          the Kunsthistorisches Museum), which keeps his works alive through regular performances
          using the original puppets. These include the above-mentioned "Christmas Play," together
          with a data bank of historical and present-day images.</p>
