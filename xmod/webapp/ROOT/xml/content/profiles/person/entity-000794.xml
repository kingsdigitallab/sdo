      <div>
        <p>Austrian pianist and composer.</p>

        <head>Career Summary</head>

        <p>Having moved with his family to Vienna in 1889, he studied piano there with <ref
            cRef="entity-000523">Leschetizky</ref> and music theory with <ref cRef="entity-000562"
            >Mandyczewski</ref>. He moved to Berlin in 1898, and between 1925 and 1933 taught at the
          Hochschule für Musik in Berlin. He left Berlin only when Hitler came to power in 1933,
          moving first to Switzerland and in 1939 emigrating to the USA, eventually returning to
          Europe.</p>

        <p>He was celebrated especially as an interpreter of Beethoven and Schubert, and made many
          recordings; but also played contemporary music (he took part in one of the early
          performances of Schoenberg's <title level="m">Pierrot lunaire</title>), and composed in a
          modernist idiom. His publications include <title level="m">My Reflections on Music</title>
          (Manchester, 1933), <title level="m">Music and the Line of Most Resistance</title>
          (Princeton, 1942) and <title level="m">My Life and Music</title> (London, 1961).</p>

        <head>Schnabel and Schenker</head>

        <p>Schenker mostly recorded unfavorable or mixed comments about Schnabel's playing in his
          diary. For example, on January 28, 1909: "Concert by A. Schnabel: Errors: forte without
          shading; lack of principal accents [and] main highpoints"; on November 4, 1929: "[Diabelli
          Variations]: basically a pianist devoid of the elements of what composers and performers
          would consider art," although he added on February 7, 1930 that Wilhelm Backhaus played
          "far worse than Schnabel." Schenker also made adverse remarks on Schnabel's Beethoven
          editing (WSLB 211). — Schenker noted much later (OJ 5/18, 33, letter to Jonas, December
          21, 1933), that <ref cRef="entity-000116">Busoni</ref> had played Schenker's <ref
            cRef="entity-001664"><title level="m">Syrian Dances</title></ref> through with Schnabel
          before writing to Schenker on February 11, 1900 that the pieces were "touched by genius"
          (OJ 9/27, [11]); this would have been between September 1899 and that date.</p>

        <p>One letter from Schnabel to Schenker survives as OJ 14/14, [1] (Dec 6, 1925).</p>
