        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Born Jan Śliwiński, son of a landscape painter and lithographer, but adopted by a couple
          Effenberger, he retained the latter name until 1914 then reverted to Śliwiński or
          Śliwiński-Effenberger. He studied in Berlin and Prague, worked as a journalist, then
          gained his doctorate with a dissertation on Nikolaus Lenau and music (1908). Between 1908
          and 1913, he worked in libraries in Prague and Vienna. He translated poems of Rabindranath
          Tagore (from English), some of which were set by Alexander Zemlinsky (<title level="m"
            >Lyrische Symphonie</title>, 1922‒23), and others by Walter Lang (<title level="m"
            >Liebesmusik</title>, 1932). </p>

        <p>Effenberger moved to Paris in 1922, opening a bookshop, then the art gallery "Au sacre du
          printemps" in Paris, at 5 rue du Cherche-Midi. There, in addition to several solo-artist
          shows, in 1928 he mounted the exhibition "Le surréalisme, existe-t-il?", which included
          works by Max Ernst, André Masson, Joan Miró, Francis Picabia, and Yves Tanguy. (In 1929,
          the gallery was taken over by Jeanne Bucher.) Effenberger had a large circle of artistic
          acquaintances, including Adolf Loos, Tristan Tzara, and James Joyce. </p>

        <p>In the 1930s, Effenberger taught at the Warsaw Military Academy, and was active as a
          composer, producer, and translator, collaborating with Szymanowski and Moniuszko. In 1938
          he emigrated, living in Scotland during World War II and returning to Warsaw in 1950. </p>
