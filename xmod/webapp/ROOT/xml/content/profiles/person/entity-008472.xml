      <head>Herr and Frau Eisenberg</head>
      <div>

        <p>Young German-Jewish couple (first names unknown), aged 22 and 20 in 1936, whom <ref
            cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette Schenker</ref> met during her travels to
          <ref cRef="entity-005845">Chile</ref>.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Frau Eisenberg’s parents, <ref cRef="entity-008473">Herr</ref> and <ref
            cRef="entity-008474">Frau Götz</ref>, lived in <ref cRef="entity-008467">Santiago</ref>.
          The Eisenberg couple were at the time living with them but planning soon to buy a house.
            <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette</ref> and they were fellow-passengers on the
          transatlantic ship, the <title><hi rend="italic">Orazio</hi></title>, so met in May 1936,
          and were then companions to <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette</ref> during her visit to
            <ref cRef="entity-008467">Santiago</ref>, June 3–August 5. They met frequently with her,
          often ate with her, and helped her to find her way round the city; in return, <ref
            cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette</ref> gave them small gifts.</p>

        <p>As to their character, <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette</ref> once remarked in her
          travel diary “they tire me, are unintelligent. The young husband has a position [working
          in a shop], at present unpaid – he cannot actually do anything! – it is a trial month”
          (June 18); but later she described them as “lovely, dear people” (June 23). It was the
          Eisenbergs who located her brother <ref cRef="entity-000783">Victor</ref>’s address in the
          city, and who drove her in a fruitless attempt to find him.</p>
