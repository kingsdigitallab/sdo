      <head>Edmund (Anton Paul) Schmid</head>

      <p>German concert pianist and teacher. Correspondent with Schenker.</p>

      <div>
        <head>Career summary</head>
        <p>Schmid studied at the Stern Conservatory in Berlin. From 1912 to 1922 he taught a piano
          class at the Bernuth Conservatory in Hamburg, and from 1923 to 1926 undertook concert
          tours. After 1926, he taught an introductory piano class at the Vogt Conservatory, Hamburg
          and also in the piano and chamber music department of the Kiel Conservatory.</p>

        <p>In 1929, Schmid was President of the Landesverband der Hansastädte (Regional Union of
          Hanseatic Cities) and of the <ref cRef="entity-002404">Reichsverband deutscher Tonkünstler
            und Musiklehrer</ref>. He was evidently interested in the source materials of composers
          such as Beethoven, Mozart, and Schubert, and wrote the article <bibl><title level="a"
              >Betrachtungen zur heutigen Beethoven-'Pflege',</title>
            <title level="j">Zeitschrift für Musik</title> 94/4 (April 1927), 197–200</bibl>.</p>
      </div>


      <div>
        <head>Correspondence</head>
        <p>In 1927 Schmid wrote a letter to Schenker (OJ 14/12) raising a point in a Beethoven
          autograph manuscript. At the same time, he corresponded with <ref cRef="entity-000951"
            >Hans Weisse</ref> about the same matter (diary, OJ 3/9, p. 3070, May 25, 1927).
          Schenker clearly took offense at what he saw as an accusation, and the "affair" rumbled on
          through June of that year in Schenker's diary.</p>

        <p>On July 24, 1929, Alfred Kalmus forwarded to Schenker (OC 52/851) some remarks that
          Schmid had written to <ref cRef="entity-002408">Universal Edition</ref> regarding
          Schenker's editing of Beethoven ‒ remarks which are not preserved with the letter, but
          which while being broadly favorable implied some criticism. Schenker responded to UE on
          July 27 (WSLB 414) with comments. On August 5, Ernst Roth forwarded to Schenker (OC
          52/853) some supplementary remarks about the latter's Beethoven editing that UE had
          received; the latter remarks survive (OJ 52/854-855). Schenker responded to UE with
          further comments on August 9 (WSLB 417). Toward UE Schenker made the best of the exchange
          by making Schmid's remarks out to be evidence that his work was now firmly established.
