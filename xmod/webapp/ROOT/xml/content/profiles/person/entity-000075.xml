      <head>Otto von Bismarck</head>
      <div>

        <p>German statesman responsible for the unification of Germany in 1871, Chancellor of
          Germany 1871‒90.</p>

        <p>Bismarck was Minister President of Prussia from 1862 and Chancellor of the North German
          Confederation from 1867 to 1871. He conducted wars against Denmark, Austria, and France
          (the Franco-Prussian War of 1871), thereafter serving as the first Chancellor of the
          Second German Empire until 1890. His greatest achievement lay in unifying hundreds of
          principalities and free cities into a single country, and making Germany one of the most
          powerful nations in Europe.</p>

        <head>Bismarck and Schenker</head>
        <p>In an early reference to him, Schenker wrote admiringly (on the day he submitted the
          Foreword to his <ref cRef="entity-001724"><title level="m">Harmonielehre</title></ref>) of
          "Bismarck's strivings and battles midst a world of midgets" (diary, October 20, 1906).
          Five years later he wrote: "Only geniuses build, and even then only where they appear
          merely to destroy! A Bismarck destroyed the lives of many people in order to found the
          German Empire!" (diary, May 30, 1911), and two years after that: "the genius-imbued (<hi
            rend="italic">genial</hi>) accomplishment of a Bismarck" (diary, October 25, 1913). In
          his unpublished 1914 article <title level="a">German Genius in Battle and Victory,</title>
          he included Bismark in a roll-call of geniuses: "the absolute heights of, say, a Caesar, a
          Frederick the Great, a Bismarck or Goethe, a Kant or Johann Sebastian Bach ..." (<ref
            type="other" cRef="OJ-21-2_1">OJ 21/2, [1]</ref>). Although Bismarck is not included in
          the several such lists in the first issue of <title level="j">Der Tonwille</title> (1921),
          he is alluded to in: "something touched by aristocratic genius, something Bismarckian ..."
            (<ref cRef="entity-001739"><title level="j">Tonwille</title> 1</ref>, p. 11; Eng.
          transl., I, p. 11).</p>
