      <head>Anton (Tonerl) [Schimatowitsch]</head>
      <div>

        <p>Possibly the elder son of <ref cRef="entity-000895">Anton (Tonschl) Schimatowitsch</ref>,
          grandson of <ref cRef="entity-0008443">Mrs. Schimatowitsch</ref>, hence “adoptive”
          grandson of <ref cRef="entity-000775">Wilhelm Schenker</ref>, and thus an “adoptive” grand
          nephew of Heinrich Schenker; older brother of <ref cRef="entity-008438">Karl (Karli)
            Schimatowitsch</ref>.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Identity</head>
        <p>The name “Tonerl” appears frequently in Schenker’s diary between 1919 and 1927, and often
          in Heinrich’s correspondence with his elder brother <ref cRef="entity-000775"
            >Wilhelm</ref> between 1925 and 1934. The surname “Schimatowitsch” is nowhere used in
          the Schenker papers; the grounds for identification are set out in the profile for <ref
            cRef="entity-000895">Anton (Tonschl) Schimatowitsch</ref>. The remainder of this profile
          is predicated on that identification.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Life Summary</head>
        <p>Tonerl was baptised in <ref cRef="entity-002340">St. Pölten</ref> on May 21, 1907, the
          first child of “<ref cRef="entity-000895">Tonschl</ref>” and his unknown wife, whose
          death, as reported by Tonerl himself, is recorded in Heinrich’s diary for January 10,
          1921. The Schimatowitsch family was close to the <ref cRef="entity-002936">Bednař
            family</ref>, Tonerl being friendly with <ref cRef="entity-000052">Heini Bednař</ref>.
          Nothing is known of Tonerl’s childhood or education other than that he and <ref
            cRef="entity-008438">Karl</ref> had mumps in 1918 when living in the household of <ref
            cRef="entity-000775">Wilhelm</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000767">Dodi Schenker</ref>,
          where they were called “the children” (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-5-38_1">OJ
            5/38, [1]</ref>, January 24, 1918); in 1923 he was a trainee at a hardware store (diary,
          November 6, 1923), and in 1925 Heinrich reports that his younger brother <ref
            cRef="entity-000774">Moriz</ref> expected to find a job for him at Rothmüller (perhaps
          the Viennese clothing manufacturer Rothmüller, Laufer &amp; Co.) (<ref
            type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-5-38_15">OJ 5/38, [15]</ref>, January 4, 1925); but by
          1927 he was out-of-work, and in September Heinrich and <ref cRef="entity-000775"
            >Wilhelm</ref> were pursuing jobs for him at a furniture store, a motorcycle company,
          and other prospects. In October 1927 he was reported to be “halfway suited." In 1934
          Heinrich inquired whether Tonerl and <ref cRef="entity-008438">Karli</ref> had been caught
          up in the Austrian civil uprising of mid-February (<ref type="correspondence"
            cRef="OJ-5-38_87">OJ 5/38, [87]</ref>, April 15, 1934). Finally we learn that Tonerl had
          become an officer in the Vienna police force (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="OC-A-296"
            >OC A/296</ref>, December 24, 1934).</p>

        <p>After their mother’s death and that of <ref cRef="entity-000767">Dodi Schenker</ref> in
          1923, <ref cRef="entity-000775">Wilhelm</ref> took primary responsibility for the
          upbringing of the two boys, with Heinrich advising, and brother <ref cRef="entity-000774"
            >Moriz</ref> (who died in 1936) and his wife <ref cRef="entity-003438">Lisl</ref>
          supporting financially. Nothing is known of Tonerl’s life during World War II or the
          post-war period. He died in 1976, aged 68 or 69; his body is buried in the Vienna
          Simmering Evangelical Cemetery, group 13, row 11, grave 5.</p>
