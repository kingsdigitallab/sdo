      <head>Bronislaw Huberman</head>

      <div>
        <p>Polish violinist, widely regarded as one of the most original concert artists of the 20th
          century.</p>

        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>As a boy, Hubermann played the Brahms Violin Concerto in front of the composer, who is
          said to have been greatly moved by the performance. He played regularly in Vienna, and
          between 1934 and 1936 taught in the violin master school at the Vienna Conservatory. He
          later helped Jewish musicians to get to Palestine, and organized the Palestine Symphony
          Orchestra.</p>

          <hi rend="bold">Hubermann and Schenker</hi>
        </p>
        <p>Huberman was greatly admired by, among others, Furtwängler. Schenker evidently
          thought well of his playing and musicianship, while harboring some reservations, as in
          this diary comment: "Hubermann has visibly grown, has at his command all the possibilities
          of tone connection and gradations of light and shade, all arts of bowing, but at the same
          time yields to the commonest of desires, which he allows to deteriorate even into
          tastelessness." (OJ 3/6, July 26, 1924).</p>
        
        <p>There is no known correspondence between Hubermann and Schenker.</p>
