        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Godowsky studied with Ernst Rudorff (close friend of Schenker) at the Berlin Hochschule
          für Musik in 1884. He was based in London 1886-90, and in the USA 1890-1900 (during
          which time he became a US citizen), thereafter returning to Berlin. In 1909, he moved to
          Vienna, where he led the piano Meisterschule at the Vienna Akademie für Musik und
          darstellende Kunst (= Conservatory) until 1914, at which point he returned to the USA. A
          stroke in 1930 ended his career, and he died in New York. (<hi rend="italic">NGDM</hi>)</p>

        </p>
        <p>There were at least two points of contact between Schenker and Godowsky. On February 6,
          1910, Schenker expressed concerned that Godowsky had been allowed to see the proofs of his
          edition of the J. S. Bach <title level="m">Chromatic Fantasy &amp; Fugue</title> when he
          himself had not yet seen them. (Hertzka explained that no proofs had yet been produced,
          and Godowsky's assistant had merely glimpsed the pile of manuscript for the work at the
          Universal Edition office: WSLB 51 and OC 52/424, February 6-7, 1910). Second, in June 1912
          Godowsky was apparently involved in an abortive attempt to form an "<ref cRef="organization_artists">Organization of Creative and Performing Artists</ref>" along
          with Moriz Rosenthal, Schenker and others.</p>
        <p>No correspondence between Schenker and Godowsky is known to exist.</p>
