      <div>

        <p>Amanuensis at the Archive of the <ref cRef="entity-002430">Gesellschaft der

        <head>Career Summary</head>

        <p>Schittenhelm trained as a singer, joined the Vienna Männergesang-Verein in 1873, and made
          his debut at the <ref cRef="entity-002778">Vienna Court Opera</ref> in 1875, from which he
          retired in 1903. He also worked as a concert artist, and was additionally a violinist in
          the Hofmusikkapelle from 1902 to 1921.</p>


        <p>In 1904 he became amanuensis at the Archive and Library of the <ref cRef="entity-002430"
            >Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde</ref>, under the direction of the archivist, <ref
            cRef="entity-000562">Eusebius Mandyczewski</ref>, a job he retained to his death in
          1923. He lived at Vienna XII/1, Bonygasse 77.</p>

        <head>Schittenhelm and Schenker</head>

        <p>Schenker (who spelt his name "Schüttenhelm", and regarded his title as "Subarchivar" =
          assistant archivist) refers to him in his diary for April 1908, where he is portrayed as
          an "honest" and "steadfastly naive" participant in an anecdote that shows up <ref
            cRef="entity-000562">Mandyczewski</ref> as dishonest. He refers to him again in the
          diary for September 15, 1920 (S. "earns 500 Kronen per month"), January 12, 1923, and in
          retrospect April 13, 1927. No correspondence between the two men is known to have taken
          place.</p>
