        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Ficker studied musicology with <ref cRef="entity-000003">Guido Adler</ref> (1855–1941) in
          Vienna, and composition with <ref cRef="entity-000888">Ludwig Thuille</ref> (1861–1907)
          and Walter Courvoisier in Munich. He earned his doctorate under Adler with a dissertation
          entitled <title level="m">Die Chromatik im italienischen Madrigal des 16.
            Jahrhunderts</title> in 1913. After war service 1914–18, he was appointed lecturer at
          the University of Innsbruck in 1920, where he founded a Musicological Seminar, and was
          promoted to professor in 1923. In 1927, the year that Adler retired, he was appointed
          co-director with Robert Lachs (1874–1978) of the <ref cRef="entity-007565">Musicological
            Seminar</ref> of the University of Vienna. In 1931 he moved to the Munich, where he was
          appointed professor at the University and director of its Musical Seminar. He published
          extensively on the polyphonic music of the late middle ages, notably that of the Trent
          Codices, and its notation, and edited several volumes of the series <title level="m"
            >Denkmäler der Tonkunst in Österreich</title>, and also on organum.</p>

        <head>Ficker and Schenker</head>
        <p>While vacationing in Igls (Tyrol), where Ficker was also staying, Schenker wrote to him
          on July 27, 1932 (FIBA 13/M01) suggesting that they meet, because the latter had expressed
          an interest in the Octet of his pupil <ref cRef="entity-000951">Hans Weisse</ref>. There
          is no evidence that Ficker responded, and the two men appear to have remained
          unaquainted.</p>
