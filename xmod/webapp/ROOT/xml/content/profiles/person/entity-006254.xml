        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Initially Goldschmidt worked for the Rothschild banking house in Vienna, but he abandoned
          that for the study of composition with Friedrich Adolf Wolf. His first success in the
          field, the oratorio <title level="m">Die sieben Todsünden</title> (1876) earned <ref
            cRef="entity-000331">Hanslick</ref>'s disapproval as being imitative of Wagner.
          Thereafter, he wrote two operas and a dramatic tone-poem, a symphonic poem, songs, chamber
          music and piano works. Goldschmidt's salon ‒ his address was Vienna I, Opernring 6 ‒ was
          an important center for Viennese musical life.</p>

        <head>Goldschmidt and Schenker</head>
        <p>Little is known of the relationship between Goldschmidt and Schenker. Reference is made
          to him and his widow in Schenker's diaries for 1906 and 1907: December 21, 1906 ("Adalbert
          von Goldschmidt's death, in total solitude!"), January 7, 1907 ("In the evening, at Mrs.
          von Goldschmidt's place"), January 9, 1907 ("Goldschmidt's picture and songs, the scent of
          which lingers as a last remembrance") (OJ 1/5, p. 31; OJ 1/6, p. 32).</p>

        <p>Schenker attended his funeral on December 23, 1906 and accompanied the coffin to the
          grave, writing a sympathetic note in his diary, but describing himself as "at one time the
          person he most detested" ‒ although Schenker appears not, during his years as a music
          critic 1891‒1901, to have reviewed any of Goldschmidt's work.</p>

        <p><ref cRef="entity-000913">Moriz Violin</ref> refers to him twice in his later
          correspondence with <ref cRef="entity-000798">Arnold Schoenberg</ref>: <ref
            type="correspondence" cRef="LC-ASC-27-45_3">LC ASC 27/45, [3]</ref>, April 17, 1938 and
            <ref type="correspondence" cRef="LC-ASC-27-45_17">LC ASC 27/45, [17]</ref>, January 26,
          1940, in the latter referring to him as "old Berty" in connection with a younger relative,
            <ref cRef="entity-007503">Nicolaus Goldschmidt</ref> in San Francisco.</p>
