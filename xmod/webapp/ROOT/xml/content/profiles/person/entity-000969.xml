      <div>

        <p>German politician of the Catholic Center Party, Chancellor under the Weimar Republic
          (1921â€’22). </p>

        <p>Wirth was elected to the Reichstag in 1914, and served on the western and eastern fronts
          until 1917. In 1920, he succeeded <ref cRef="entity-003136">Matthias Erzberger</ref> as
          Minister of Finance in the Weimar Republic and carried through the latter's system of
          national taxation. In 1921, in face of an Allied ultimatum on war reparations, he became
          Chancellor and formed a new cabinet along cross-party lines, retained finance for himself,
          appointed <ref cRef="entity-000688">Walter Rathenau</ref> Minister of Reconstructions, and
          accepted the Allies' terms. He is well known for his speech before the Reichstag after the
          assassination of Rathenau in 1922. </p>

        <p> In 1925, he left the Catholic Center Party in protest against its close ties with the
          Nationalist Party, and in 1929 he joined the Social Democratic Party. After Hitler's rise
          to power in 1933, he was forced into exile. After World War II, he returned to German
          politics.</p>
