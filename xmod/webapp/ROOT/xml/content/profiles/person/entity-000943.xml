      <head>Arnold Weil</head>
      <div>

        <p>Husband of <ref cRef="entity-000944">Rosa, <hi rend="italic">née</hi> Schiff</ref>,
          father of <ref cRef="entity-005248">Lene (Helena)</ref>; sister-in-law of <ref
            cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette Schenker</ref>.</p>

        <head>Life Summary</head>
        <p>Arnold Weil was born in Turnau (now Turnov, Czech Republic), son of Rosa (b. 1845, <hi
            rend="italic">née</hi> Löwy) and Ernst (c1829–1905) Weil. Nothing is known of his
          childhood or education. His profession can only be guessed as perhaps attorney or
          accountant. Arnold married <ref cRef="entity-000944">Rosa (<hi rend="italic">née</hi>
            Schiff)</ref>, sister of <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette Schenker</ref>, and the
          couple had one daughter, <ref cRef="entity-005248">Lene</ref>, born December 5, 1907. They
          lived for much of their married life in <ref cRef="entity-002248">Aussig on the Elbe (Ustí
            nad Labem)</ref>, where <ref cRef="entity-000944">Rosa</ref> and her siblings had all
          been born. In Fall 1938 (after the annexation of Austria) Arnold and <ref
            cRef="entity-000944">Rosa</ref> moved to Kutná Hora, then to <ref cRef="entity-002892"
            >Prague</ref> by September 1939, where they were sharing an apartment with “the
          children” (presumably <ref cRef="entity-005248">Lene</ref>, her first husband Max Gutmann,
          and first child or perhaps both children).</p>

        <p>In 1934, <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette</ref>, in a (lost) letter to <ref
            cRef="entity-000944">Rosa</ref>, evidently described Arnold as having “assumed the role
          that our <ref cRef="entity-008431">father</ref> had played in the family,” a sentiment
          that <ref cRef="entity-000944">Rosa</ref> heartily endorsed (<ref type="correspondence"
            cRef="OJ-14-10_15">OJ 14/10, [15]</ref>), saying: “What in other families a
          responsibly-minded brother takes on he, as a brother-in-law, has willingly taken on his
          shoulders, since none of our brothers is in a position, or is willing, to do so.” This
          involved helping family members when in difficulties, assisting in cases of illness, and
          delivering bad news. It was Arnold who wrote informing <ref cRef="entity-000771"
            >Jeanette</ref> of the tragic death of <ref cRef="entity-003244">Klara</ref>’s son <ref
            cRef="entity-008428">Hellmut</ref> in a climbing accident in 1932, and that of <ref
            cRef="entity-003244">Klara</ref> herself after a long period of insanity in 1939.</p>

        <p>Following deportation of the Jews from Bohemia, Arnold and <ref cRef="entity-000944"
            >Rosa</ref> were both transported to <ref cRef="entity-007493">Auschwitz</ref>
          II-Birkenau, where they died in 1942.</p>

        <head>Correspondence</head>
        <p>Thirty-eight items of correspondence from Arnold and Rosa to Jeanette survive in OJ
          14/10, of which Arnold wrote seven entirely on his own, mostly in his distinctive, debased
          Sütterlinschrift, signing or annotating a number of others written by Rosa. The
          Arnold-Rosa correspondence is of prime importance as a source of information on the Schiff
          family.</p>
