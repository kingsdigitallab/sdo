        <p>Russian concert pianist, occasional pupil of Schenker's.</p>

        <p>Wife of the Ukrainian lyric tenor Israel Levenson (stage name Alexandr Davidoff,
          1872–1944), Sonja Davydoff seems to have been an occasional pupil of Schenker’s in the
          mid-1900s. In 1908–10 she was living in St. Petersburg. She is listed as recipient of a
          free copy of his <ref cRef="entity-001721"><title level="m">Beitrag zur
            Ornamentik</title></ref> in a 1908 letter from Schenker to <ref cRef="entity-002408"
            >Universal Edition</ref> (WSLB 14, August 19, 1908), where the description “first-class
          concert pianist in Russia, who does a lot for me” suggests that he considered her an
          advocate in Russia for his work, which includes her having performed his unpublished
          edition of a chamber concerto there – possibly the <ref cRef="entity-004887">A minor
            keyboard concerto by C. P. E. Bach (Helm 403)</ref>, on which Schenker had worked in
          1903–04 and had himself performed in Vienna in 1904. Again in 1910 Schenker ordered a
          complimentary copy of his edition of J. S. Bach’s <ref cRef="entity-001730"><title
              level="m">Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue</title></ref> to be sent to her (WSLB 66/67,
          October 19, 1910). Nothing more is known of her, and there is no surviving correspondence
          between Schenker and her.</p>
