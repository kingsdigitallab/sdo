      <head>Johann George Albrechtsberger</head>
      <div>

        <p>Austrian composer, teacher, theorist, and organist.</p>

        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Trained in counterpoint and thoroughbass while a choirboy at Klosterneuburg and Melk
          Abbey, Albrechtsberger subsequently worked as an organist in several places within Austria
          before being appointed organist to the imperial court orchestra in 1772, then assistant to
          the Kapellmeister of St Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna in 1791, then first Kapellmeister in
          1793, a position he held until his death. At Haydn's recommendation, Beethoven took
          lessons in composition with him in 1794 and 1795.</p>

        <p>A prolific composer, he wrote choral music for the church, orchestral and chamber music,
          and keyboard works. But it is as a theorist that he is best remembered today, especially
          for the pedagogical works: <listBibl>
            <bibl><title level="m">Gründliche Anweisung zur Composition ...</title> (Leipzig,
              1790)</bibl>
            <bibl><title level="m">Kurzgefasste Methode den Generalbass zu erlernen</title> (Vienna,
              c.1791)</bibl>
          </listBibl></p>

        <p>both of which were translated into French and English and gained a wide readership.</p>

        <head>Albrechtsberger and Schenker</head>
        <p>Schenker owned a copy of the original edition of the <title level="m">Gründliche
            Anweisung</title>, still in his library at the time of his death. As his diary shows, he
          studied it closely during the August of 1906 as part of preparatory studies for his <ref
            cRef="entity-001725"><title level="m">Kontrapunkt</title></ref>. Although he believed
          the two most important treatises of the 18th century to be <ref cRef="entity-000269"
            >Fux</ref>'s <title level="m">Gradus ad Parnassum</title> (1725) and <ref
            cRef="entity-000025">C. P. E. Bach</ref>'s <title level="m">Versuch über die wahre Art,
            das Clavier zu spielen</title> (1753‒62), he considered Albrechtsberger an authority to
          be cited. In the first volume of <ref cRef="entity-001725"><title level="m"
              >Kontrapunkt</title></ref>, he discusses the <title level="m">Anweisung</title>
          somewhat disparagingly in his Introduction, then cites him, often quoting his music
          examples, at the end of each section of the volume in conjunction with other theorists
          (primarily Fux, Cherubini, and Bellermann). He continues this process at each stage
          throughout the second volume, including the final section, "Bridges to Free Composition."
