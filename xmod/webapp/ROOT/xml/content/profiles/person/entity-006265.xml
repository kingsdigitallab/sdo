      <head>Margarete (Grete) Bum</head>
      <div>

        <p>Austrian mezzo-soprano.</p>

        <p>Margarete Bum (<hi rend="italic">née</hi> Pollak), whose husband was Dr. Rudolf Pollak,
          dentist, and whose home address was Vienna I, Wipplingerstraße 6, was a mezzo-soprano
          singing Lieder and oratorio in Vienna in the 1900s and 1910s. She is notable for one
          particular performance:</p>

        <p>On March 31, 1913 she sang <ref cRef="entity-003005">Alexander Zemlinsky</ref>'s
            <title>[Six] Songs (Maeterlinck)</title> (1910‒13) with orchestral accompaniment in the
          Great Hall of the Musiverein Building. Her "inexperience, and insecure intonation
          frustrated preparations [in rehearsal] and necessitated that <ref cRef="entity-000061"
            >[Alban] Berg</ref> coach her intensely" (Moskovitz, pp. 148 and 149). However,
          when Berg first met her, on March 13, he wrote Schoenberg: "I have just come from seeing
          Mrs Bum. She has, so far as I can judge, a pleasant-sounding ‒ though not very big ‒
          voice, and appears to be musical. I think she will sing the Zemlinsky Songs very well"
            (<title level="m">Briefwechsel</title>, p. 635). The performance was apparently a
          success.</p>

        <head>Bum and Schenker</head>
        <p>On March 23, 1908, Schenker's diary records "Mrs Bum (wife of Dr Bum) heard." The
          circumstances under which Schenker "heard" her on this day are entirely unclear. Three
          days later, the diary records: "Concert in the evening : Bum, Stolz, Floriz and Dohnányi."
          This concert took place in the Bösendorfer Recital Hall, the performers being Margarete
          Bum (voice), Eugenie Stoltz (cello), <ref cRef="entity-000913">Moriz Violin</ref> and <ref
            cRef="entity-000169">Ernö Dohnányi</ref> (piano). The program is not specified. It seems
          likely that this Margarete Bum was Margarete Grete Bum. Schenker was closely acquainted
          with a branch of the Pollak family.</p>

          Schönberg Center, Vienna, for their kind assistance.</p>
