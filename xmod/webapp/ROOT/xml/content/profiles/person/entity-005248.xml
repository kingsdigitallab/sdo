      <head>Lene (Helena) Weil</head>
      <div>

        <p>Daughter of <ref cRef="entity-000944">Rosa Weil (<hi rend="italic">née</hi> Schiff)</ref>
          and <ref cRef="entity-000943">Arnold Weil</ref>, hence niece of <ref cRef="entity-000771"
            >Jeanette Schenker (<hi rend="italic">née</hi> Schiff)</ref>.</p>

        <head>Life Summary</head>
        <p>Born Helena, but known as “Lene,” she was brought up in <ref cRef="entity-002248">Ústi
            nad Labem (Aussig on the Elbe)</ref>. In 1925, <ref cRef="entity-000781">Anna
            Schiff</ref> described her as “turning into a strikingly pretty, buxom girl, who is
          exceptionally bright academically” (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-14-8_1">OJ 14/8,
            [1]</ref>). She is mentioned four times in <ref cRef="entity-000632">Heinrich</ref>’s
          diary, visiting him and <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette</ref> on March 26, 1930, aged
          22, after which <ref cRef="entity-000632">Heinrich</ref> recorded: “she behaves modestly,
          seems sufficiently intelligent to enjoy life, even when rather strict demands are placed
          on it; whether she will maintain and justify these demands, only time will tell.”</p>

        <p>For a time, she worked in medical institutions in <ref cRef="entity-002501">Berlin</ref>,
            <ref cRef="entity-002892">Prague</ref>, and elsewhere as an intern, going on to study
          medicine and to graduate Doctor of Medicine (M.U.Dr.). In October or early November 1935
          she visited Jeanette in Vienna, and was reportedly much impressed by Heinrich’s work and
          Jeanette’s organizing of his papers (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-14-10_29">OJ
            14/10, [29]</ref>), and <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette</ref> sent her a copy of the
            <ref cRef="entity-000327">Victor Hammer</ref> mezzotint of <ref cRef="entity-000632"
            >Heinrich</ref> (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-14-10_28">OJ 14/10, [28]</ref>).
          She was also a keen skier.</p>

        <p>She married Max Gutmann, M.U.Dr. in August 1936 (so became Helena Gutmannová), and there
          is a suggestion in (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-14-10_34">OJ 14/10, [34]</ref>)
          that she bore a child around April 1, 1938. Max died on a death march in Poland on October
          30, 1944. Secondly, she married Arnošt Freschl (becoming Helena Freschlová), who died in
          1968. At some point she apparently moved to Germany; where she died; nothing is known of
          her later life.</p>

        <p>No correspondence between her and the Schenkers is known to survive. She is frequently
          referred to in <ref cRef="entity-000944">Rosa Weil</ref>’s correspondence with them (OJ
          14/10).</p>
