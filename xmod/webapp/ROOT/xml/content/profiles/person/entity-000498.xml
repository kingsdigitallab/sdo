      <head>Wilhelm Kux</head>
      <div>

        <p>Austrian banker and collector of musical instruments and autographs.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Wilhelm Kux, one of ten children of Dr. Markus and Charlotte Kux, was a prominent
          Viennese banker and a keen amateur music enthusiast. He joined the <ref
            cRef="entity-002467">Austrian Provincial Bank</ref> in 1889, becoming its director
          c.1895, then moving to the directorship of the Lower Austrian Discount Bank (<hi
            rend="italic">Eskompte-Gesellschaft</hi>) in 1905 and serving as its vice-president from
          1927 to the bank’s closure in 1934.</p>

        <p>Kux collected both musical instruments (including a violin by Guarneri and a viola (‘Kux,
          Castelbarco’) and violin (‘Kux, Rothschild’) by Stradivari) and manuscripts, among them
          the autograph of <ref cRef="entity-002857">Brahms’s <title>Third String
            Quartet</title></ref> and a sketch leaf for <ref cRef="entity-001212">Beethoven’s
              <title>“Moonlight” Sonata</title></ref>. As a director of the <ref
            cRef="entity-002430">Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde</ref>, he would have known its chief
          archivist, <ref cRef="entity-000562">Eusebius Mandyczewki</ref>, who arranged for a
          facsimile of the <ref cRef="entity-001212"><title>“Moonlight”</title></ref> sketches to be
          published in the Munich-based journal <title level="j">Der Wächter</title> in 1919. It was
            <ref cRef="entity-000164">Otto Erich Deutsch</ref> who learned about the sketch leaf and
          wrote to Kux for permission to have it reproduced in Schenker’s forthcoming facsimile
          edition of the <ref cRef="entity-001754"><title>“Moonlight” Sonata</title> autograph</ref>
            (<ref cRef="entity-002408">Universal Edition</ref>, 1921), the first volume of “Musical
          Rarities” of which <ref cRef="entity-000164">Deutsch</ref> was the series editor.</p>

        <p>When Austria was annexed to Nazi Germany, Kux fled to <ref cRef="entity-005382"
            >Chur</ref>, <ref cRef="entity-002507">Switzerland</ref>, and remained there until his
          death, nearly three decades later, at the age of 101. He was made an honorary member of
          the <ref cRef="entity-002430">Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde</ref> in 1947.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Kux and Schenker</head>
        <p>Schenker dedicated his <title level="m">Ländler für Pianoforte</title>, Op. 10 (Berlin:
            <ref cRef="entity-002448">N. Simrock</ref>, 1899) to “Herrn Wilhelm Kux” (a copy of
          which – a presentation copy to <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette Schenker</ref> with
          autograph inscription “Lie-Liechen” – is preserved at OJ 23/5). Their acquaintance must
          therefore have preceded 1899.</p>

        <p>Kux appears in Schenker’s diary eighteen times between 1906 and 1933. On two occasions,
          the subject concerned the honesty of his <ref cRef="entity-000774">banker brother Moriz
            (Mozio)</ref> (“<ref cRef="entity-000913">Floriz</ref> ... quotes Kux as saying <ref
            cRef="entity-000774">Mozio</ref> is a very rich man but has a bad character”). In March
          1933, Schenker tried unsuccessfully to involve Kux in the plight of his friend <ref
            cRef="entity-000913">Moriz Violin</ref>, who was facing difficulties with the Nazi
          authorities in <ref cRef="entity-002286">Munich</ref>, where he was running a Schenker
          Institute. But the majority of the references fall between August and November 1920 and
          concern Kux’s Beethoven sketch leaves.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Correspondence</head>
        <p>There are five calling cards from Wilhelm Kux to Schenker, spanning c.1903–10 (OJ 12/28),
          most inviting Schenker to meet with him. Schenker’s diary gives evidence of letters that
          he wrote to Kux that do not survive. Kux is also mentioned in six letters and postcards
          from <ref cRef="entity-000164">Otto Erich Deutsch</ref> to Schenker, all from 1920,
          concerning Kux’s Beethoven sketch leaf. </p>
