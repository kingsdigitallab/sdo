      <head>Gerhard Albersheim</head>

        <p>German pianist and writer on music.</p>

      <div>
        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Albersheim first studied piano, cello, and music theory in Cologne, then worked with
          Schenker for three years, 1926-29. While giving private tuition and working as a
          repetiteur, he took a PhD in physics and musicology at Vienna University, 1933-38,
          publishing his dissertation in 1939. He emigrated to the United States in 1939, holding
          teaching positions in Los Angeles, working as a pianist and accompanist to singers
          (including Elisabeth Schumann, Ezio Pinza, and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau), and writing
          journal articles on music theoretical and educational topics. After retirement in 1969, he
          took up residence in Switzerland.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <head>Albersheim and Schenker</head>
        <p>Albersheim first approached Schenker, at the recommendation of Felix Hupka, in May 1926
          (OJ 9/5, [1]). He began lessons on October 5, 1926, and continued his studies until June
          14, 1929, taking two lessons a week (Mondays and Fridays). Notes on these lessons survive
          in Schenker's lessonbooks for 1926/27 through 1928/29, and also in OC 38/56-67. His
          lessons included not only study of the keyboard repertory, but also intensive study of
          opera (Mozart, Verdi, Wagner), choral, chamber, and orchestral works, often with Urlinie
          graphs, to which Schenker himself devoted considerable preparation time, and also music
          theory, performance practice, and source studies. One lesson in January 1928 was occupied
          with a two-hour discussion of anti-semitism.</p>

          <head>Correspondence with Schenker</head>
        <p>Four items of correspondence from Albersheim and his father, Josef Albersheim, to
          Schenker survive (OJ 9/5 and OC B/136-138), and one draft letter from Schenker to Josef
          Albersheim as OJ 5/5; but some thirty more items are recorded in Schenker's diary as
          having been sent or received, thus the correspondence was quite extensive. We know, also,
          that Schenker wrote to Bruno Walter recommending Albersheim in January 1928 (OJ 4/1, p.
          3163), and tried to pull strings for him in pursuit of a conducting career in April 1929
          (OJ 4/2, p. 3331), as well as advising him on career choices in lessons and
          correspondence.</p>
        <p>In 1930, Albersheim drafted an article promoting Schenker's theory; Schenker read and
          commented on this draft (preserved with his annotations as OC B/112-134), and Albersheim
          replied in light of those comments (OC B/136-138); the article was published in 1931.</p>
