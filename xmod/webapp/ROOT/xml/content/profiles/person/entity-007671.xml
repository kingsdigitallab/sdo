          College in St. Louis, Missouri. by 1927/28 he is listed as the College's Secretary and
          General Manager. The College was renamed the St. Louis Institute of Music c. 1929, and in

          Missouri Music Teachers Association. He is listed in the United States Educational

        <head>Stuart and the Moriz Violin</head>
        <p>Stuart informed <ref cRef="entity-000798">Arnold Schoenberg</ref> that he had a position
          open in composition at the St. Louis Institute of Music, and would like to appoint one of
            <ref cRef="entity-000798">Schoenberg</ref>'s own pupils. In January 1940 <ref
            cRef="entity-000798">Schoenberg</ref> urged Schenker's closest friend <ref
            cRef="entity-000913">Moriz Violin</ref>, who had emigrated from Vienna to <ref
            cRef="
                entity-002921">San Francisco</ref> in May/June 1939, to apply for
          the position. <ref cRef="entity-000798">Schoenberg</ref> wrote Stuart a letter in which,
          while listing many of his own American-based pupils, he urged him to appoint <ref
            cRef="entity-000913">Violin</ref> as "the man whom I considered the most suitable." <ref
            cRef="entity-000913">Violin</ref> submitted an application, but was rejected by Stuart
          in a letter of April 8. Behind the rejection is thought to have been <ref
            cRef="entity-000271">Gottfried Galston</ref>, who had been Professor of Piano at the
          Institute since 1927, and who feared <ref cRef="entity-000798">Violin</ref> as a
          rival.</p>

        <head>Correspondence</head>
        <p>One letter from Stuart to <ref cRef="entity-000913">Violin</ref>, dated April 2, 1940, is
          preserved as <ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-70-38_1">OJ 70/38, [1]</ref>. <ref
            cRef="entity-000913">Violin</ref>'s application letter does not survive, but draft
          materials exist in OJ 70/1, [1]. There is also correspondence between <ref
            cRef="entity-000798">Schoenberg</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000913">Violin</ref> in
          January‒April 1940 concerning Stuart and the job application (LC ASC 27/45, [17]‒[20], LC
          ASC 7/50, [8]‒[11], OJ 70/35, [7]). Additionally, one letter from Stuart to <ref
            cRef="entity-000798">Schoenberg</ref>, and one from <ref cRef="entity-000798"
            >Schoenberg</ref> to Stuart, both survive, and are quoted in Auner (2003).</p>
