      <head>Adolf Türtscher</head>
      <div>

        <p>Hotel proprietor in <ref cRef="entity-002292">Galtür</ref>, in the Austrian Tyrol; mayor
          of the village 1928‒38. </p>

        <head>Biographical summary</head>
        <p>Adolf Türtscher was one of the four children of <ref cRef="entity-002927">Franz
            Anton</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-002928">Emerenzia</ref> Türtscher, who owned the small
          hotels <ref cRef="entity-002933">Rössle</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-002934">Alpenhaus
            Fluchthorn</ref> in Galtür. In the early 1920s, Adolf took over the management of the
          Alpenhaus Fluchthorn, which he expanded to a full-scale hotel. He purchased an automobile
          with which he began offering personal transport, which later turned into a scheduled
          private line. </p>

        <p>Türtscher involved himself in all branches of the newly developing tourism of Galtür.
          From the first musical ensemble to most of the societies, he worked as initiator, leader,
          or energetic promoter. His two secretaries, who were employed in the Alpenhaus Fluchthorn,
          produced the village brochures and recruited guests from all over Europe. They were the
          precursors of the Galtür tourist agency. </p>

        <p>During his time as mayor, Galtür developed into a sizeable resort for foreign tourists.
          That this was even possible in the inter-war period is to be attributed in good part to
          his far-sightedness and the good relations that he established. </p>

        <head>Adolf Türtscher and the Schenkers</head>

        <p>Heinrich and Jeanette Schenker spent their summers at the Alpenhaus Fluchthorn in
          1921‒31. They also corresponded with Adolf Türtscher during Heinrich's teaching season,
          and one fragment of a letter from Adolf to Schenker survives as OC 10/211 (no date). </p>
