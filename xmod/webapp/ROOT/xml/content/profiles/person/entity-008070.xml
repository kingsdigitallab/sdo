      <head>Teresa Carreño [Teresa d’Albert]</head>
      <div>

        <p>Venezuelan pianist, soprano, and composer; second wife of <ref cRef="entity-000150">Eugen
            d’Albert</ref>.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Carreño studied piano and voice in Venezuela before relocating to New York City in 1862
          and making her debut there as pianist that year. In 1866 she moved to Paris, studying
          voice in the late 1870s with Rossini and others and beginning her career in opera with
          Meyerbeer’s <title level="m">Les Huguenots</title>. Returning to the U.S.A., she toured
          extensively, marrying Emile Sauret in 1873. Thereafter she toured widely as both a pianist
          and a singer in the U.S.A. and Europe, and eventually in Venezuela, gaining popularity all
          the time.</p>

        <p>She became <ref cRef="entity-000150">Eugen d’Albert</ref>’s second wife in 1892 (it was
          her third or fourth marriage), the marriage lasting less than two years, during which the
          couple had two daughters, before d’Albert turned to <ref cRef="entity-000151">Hermine
            Fink</ref>, marrying her in 1895. Carreño’s career continued, with ever more widespread
          touring, and recording for player piano, until the year in which she died.</p>

        <p>Carreño composed music for chorus, orchestra, chamber ensembles, voice with piano, and
          solo piano, much of which was published, mostly between 1875 and the later 1880s.</p>
