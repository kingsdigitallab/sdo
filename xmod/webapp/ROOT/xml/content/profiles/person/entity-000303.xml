      <head>Max Graf</head>
      <div>
        <p>Influential Austrian music critic.</p>

        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>As part of his degree at the University of Vienna, Graf studied music history with
          Eduard Hanslick, and (like Schenker) studied harmony at the Vienna Conservatory with
          Bruckner, his doctoral dissertation being on the music of the Renaissance (1896). From
          1903 to 1938 he taught music aesthetics and music history at the Vienna Conservatory,
          serving also as music critic for several prominent journals and newspapers.</p>
        <p>He wrote ground-breaking articles on Bruckner and Hugo Wolf, wrote for <ref cRef="zeit_die_wien"><title level="j">Die Zeit</title></ref>, the <title level="j">Österreichische Rundschau</title>, and other Viennese papers, and was a strong
          advocate of Mahler, Debussy, Strauss, Schoenberg, Stravinsky and other contemporary
          composers. In 1938, he emigrated to the USA, where he taught at the New School for Social
          Research, New York, and elsewhere, and worked as a critic. He returned to Austria in 1947.
          He remains well-known especially for his <title level="m">Composer and Critic: Two Hundred
            Years of Musical Criticism</title> (London: Chapman &amp; Hall, 1947), with its
          sparkling account of the Viennese musical world c. 1900.</p>

        <head>Graf and Schenker</head>
        <p>Graf first appears in Schenker's diary in an entry dated October 19, 1903, recording
          Graf's review of his <title level="m">Beitrag zur Ornamentik</title> (OJ 1/2, p. 10: the
          review, in the <ref cRef="neues_wiener_journal"><title level="j">Neues Wiener
            Journal</title></ref> of that date, survives in Schenker's scrapbook, OC 2/p. 5); and on
          November 26, 1910, Schenker comments caustically on Graf's book <title level="m">Die
            innere Werkstatt des Musikers</title> (Stuttgart, 1910) (OJ 1/9, p. 119). Graf was later
          to review Schenker's <title level="m">Beethoven's Neunte Sinfonie</title> (1912), <title level="m">Die letzten fünf Sonaten von Beethoven ... op. 109</title> (1913) (OC
          2/pp. 29, 39), and probably also <title level="m">Harmonielehre</title> (1906) (CA 66,
          March 30, 1907). Schenker seems to have acquired a hostile attitude toward Graf, as
          illustrated in his encounter with the Vienna Concert House Society in 1914, when he
          suspected Graf's motives for recommending him for a series of lectures.</p>

      <div>
        <head>Correspondence with Schenker</head>
        <p>Two letters (dated 1910?) from Graf to Schenker survive (OJ 11/25), and one from
          Schenker to Graf (OC 1 A/3 (1911).</p>
