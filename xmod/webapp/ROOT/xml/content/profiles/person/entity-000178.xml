      <head>John Petrie Dunn</head>
      <div>
        <p>Scottish pianist, theorist, and writer on music.</p>

        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Dunn studied at Edinburgh University with Friedrich Niecks and later at the Stuttgart
          Conservatory with Samuel de Lange (theory) and Max von Pauer (piano), and in 1902 joined
          the teaching faculty there. In 1909 he was appointed to the Kiel Conservatory, first as
          professor of piano, later as deputy director, but returned to Britain in 1914, serving in
          the Royal Scots regiment and being wounded in World War I. After the war, he settled in
          Edinburgh (Scotland), where he worked as piano teacher and concert artist, later teaching
          music theory at Edinburgh University 1920-31.</p>
        <p>His books include <title level="m">Das Geheimnis der Handführung beim
            Klavierspiel</title> (1914), <title level="m">Ornamentation in the Works of
            Chopin</title> (London: Novello, 1921), <title level="m">A Student's Guide to
            Orchestration</title> (London: Novello, 1928), based on his Edinburgh DMus thesis, and
            <title level="m">The Basis of Pianoforte Playing</title> (London: OUP, 1933), completed
          posthumously by his wife, Aline Dunn (a native German-speaker). He was killed in a street
          accident in 1931.</p>
        <p><ref cRef="entity-000896">Donald Francis Tovey</ref>, in an “appreciation” published
          February 6, 1931, spoke of his “noble achievements as an artist,” and concluded that in
          addition to piano he possessed “considerable skill on many other instruments; his
          knowledge of orchestration was profound and exhaustive; he had an extraordinary knack for
          giving his pupils a sound grasp of counterpoint; and, in fact, his province was the whole
          of music.”</p>

      <div>
        <head>Dunn and Schenker</head>
        <p>Though never a pupil of Schenker's, Dunn became a disciple of his on the basis of the
          study of Schenker's writings, and Schenker took pride in the fact that his theory was
          being taught in Edinburgh. Dunn prepared an abbreviated English translation of Parts III
          and IV of Schenker's <ref cRef="entity-001727">
            <title>Kontrapunkt</title> 2</ref>, and had intended also to translate “Bridges to Free
          Composition,” all of which remained unpublished.</p>
        <p>A verbal portrait of Dunn is presented by Anthony van Hoboken when he visited him in
          September 1927: OJ 11/54, [18], September 18, 1927. [insert link]</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Correspondence and Portraits</head>
        <p>There survive a copy of one (draft?) letter from Schenker to Dunn dated July 8, 1928 (OC
          30/122-124), five others from Schenker to Dunn that are not known to have survived, eight
          letters from Dunn to Schenker, 1926-30 (OJ 10/13), and two from Dunn's widow dated 1931
          (OJ 10/12), enclosing a clipping and typed German translation of the obituary and Tovey's
          "appreciation" for Dunn in <title level="j">The Scotsman</title>, February 6, 1931.</p>
        <p>Schenker owned two inscribed photographic portraits, one of John, one of John and Aline
          (OJ 72/4), and a copy of <title level="m">A Student's Guide to Orchestration</title> (OC
          2/p. 80); this work contains what is probably the first published translation of an
          extract from Schenker's writings (taken from the monograph on Beethoven's Ninth
          Symphony).</p>
