      <div>
        <p>Mother of Schenker's pupil and friend <ref cRef="entity-000107">Robert Brünauer</ref>.
          Prior to January 1918, she had been a pupil of <ref cRef="entity-000416">Marianne
            Kahn</ref>.</p>

        <p>Camilla Brünauer was the wife of <ref cRef="entity-006263">Jacob (Jacques)
          Brünauer</ref>, chocolate manufacturer, and partner in the firm with her husband from
          1900, and from 1916 with her son.</p>

        <head>Camilla Brünauer and Schenker</head>

        <p>Camilla is mentioned a number times in Schenker's diary, and there are records of
          correspondence sent and received, though none is known to survive. As a representative of
          the commercial world, she was regarded by Schenker as money-minded. On one occasion, she
          had asked Schenker for lessons and he had responded defensively, to which she replied:
          "From Mama Brünauer (letter): declares herself prepared to invite us both [Heinrich and
          Jeanette were not yet married], and is also in a position to let us participate in the
          meal despite the war, regrets finally that I cannot spare her one to two lessons on
          account of work." (OJ 2/5, pp. 554-555, December 29, 1916). It is she who made the telling
          remark to Marianne Kahn, which Schenker quoted in his diary: "Your pupils surely provide
          for you during these days, don't they?" (OJ 2/10 p. 832, January 23, 1918).</p>
