        <head>Career Summary</head>

        <p>Michael Hainisch was elected the first president of the Republic of Austria after the
          fall of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1918, serving for two terms, from 1920 to 1928.
          Despite encouragement, he declined to serve for a third term. He was not affiliated to any
          of the current political parties.</p>

        <p>Having owned estates and, in addition to having practised as a lawyer, been a farmer
          before his elevation, he was prominent in developing the agricultural sector in Austria,
          encouraged the electrification of the railway system, and tried to develop tourism,
          especially in the Alps. He supported pan-German ideas, and was later a supporter of the
          annexation of Austria in 1938.</p>
