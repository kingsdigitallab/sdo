        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Malvine Burstein made her debut in Vienna in 1868, having studied with Carl Tausig and
          Franz Liszt. In 1871 she married medical doctor and writer Moriz Brée (1842‒1916). In the
          1870s she studied with Sofie Menter, and from 1882 with <ref cRef="entity-000523">Theodor
            Leschetizky</ref>, whose assistant she became in 1893, publishing an account of his
          "method" in 1902, as well as establishing her own school of piano in Vienna, her pupils
          including <ref cRef="entity-000629">Elly Ney</ref>, <ref cRef="entity-000794">Arthur
            Schabel</ref>, <ref cRef="entity-000971">Paul von Wittgenstein</ref>, and <ref
            cRef="entity-000754">Felix Salzer</ref>. She established an international career as a
          concert artist, and formed a piano trio with Eugenie Epstein (violin) and Rudophine
          Epstein (cello) as the "Damen-Trio," which also performed internationally. She published
          articles and the book:<lb/>

        <head>Brée and Schenker</head>

        <p>Schenker was certainly aware of Malwine Brée as another piano teacher in Vienna, and made
          passing reference to her in his diaries for 1919 and 1924, but there seems to be no
          evidence that he was personally acquainted, and there is no surviving correspondence
          between the two.</p>
