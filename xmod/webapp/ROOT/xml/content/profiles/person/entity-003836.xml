          <head>Career Summary</head>
          <p>Kabasta studied at the Vienna <ref cRef="entity-002591">Academy for Music and
              Performing Art</ref>. After World War I he taught music at the Federal Institute of
            Education at Traiskirchen, subsequently taking up conducting positions in Wiener
            Neustadt and Baden bei Wien before in 1926 being appointed General Music Director in
            Graz as well as guest conductor with the <ref cRef="entity-002430">Gesellschaft der
              Musikfreunde</ref> in Vienna.</p>

          <p>In 1931 he became director of <ref cRef="entity-002755">Radio Vienna</ref> in
            combination with a teaching position in the conducting school of the <ref
              cRef="entity-002591">Vienna Academy</ref> 1933â€’35. In 1935 he became principal

          <head>Kabasta and the Schenker Circle</head>
          <p>Beginning in 1927, Schenker listened to radio broadcasts of several concerts conducted
            by Kabasta, neutrally, without either favorable or adverse comment.</p>

          <p>Two of Schenker's pupils requested letters of recommendation from Schenker to Kabasta:
              <ref cRef="entity-000034">Carl Bamberger</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000964">Manfred
              Willfort</ref>. On December 11, 1933, Willfort spoke "about Kabasta's high regard for"
            Schenker, and four days later Salzer and Willfort together spoke of Kabasta's "great
            admiration" for Schenker's work; and on January 14, 1934 Salzer again spoke of Kabasta's
            "enthusiasm" and intention to visit" Schenker. On March 23, 1934 Willfort admitted that
            he was already in his second year as a pupil of Kabasta. On December 12, 1933 Schenker
            reported in his diary that his nephew and pupil <ref cRef="entity-000769">Georg
              Schenker</ref> had been "taken on by Kabasta" (in the Vienna Symphony).</p>

          <p>There is no correspondence between Kabasta and Schenker in the Oswald Jonas or Ernst
            Oster Collections.</p>
