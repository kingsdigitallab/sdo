        <head>Furtwängler and Schenker</head>
        <p>Son of a well-known archaeologist, Wilhelm Furtwängler studied with Rheinberger and von
          Schillings. In 1913, while working as Kapellmeister in Lübeck, he first read Schenker's
          monograph <title level="m">Beethovens neunte Sinfonie</title> (1912). Remembering his
          initial reactions, he stressed Schenker's renunciation of hermeneutics and historicism as
          having been revelatory for him, although he admitted that he was appalled by his polemics,
          which "in many cases went too far" (<title level="a">Heinrich Schenker: Ein zeitgemäßes
            Problem,</title> in <title level="m">Ton und Wort</title>). However, it was not until
          May 1919 (the year in which he became conductor of the Viennese Tonkünstler-Orchester,
          after which he worked for the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde) that he met Schenker, the
          latter's account in his diary being rather positive as Furtwängler had shown himself
          "willing to serve a timely mission" (diary, OJ 2/14, pp. 2065-2067, May 4, 1919; also Sbb
          55 Nachl 13, [1], November 5, 1919). Schenker gave Furtwängler advice about analytical
          details, and the latter readily accepted and sought this advice, though he never became
          Schenker's pupil.</p>
        <p>Their relationship soon transcended mere analytical instruction. Furtwängler and Schenker
          ultimately discussed all kinds of professional matters, sometimes even social, political,
          and religious questions. As he became increasingly influential in German musical life (as
          Generalmusikdirektor in Berlin, 1928, chief conductor at Bayreuth in 1931), Furtwängler
          repeatedly pleaded on behalf of Schenker's pupils (especially <ref cRef="entity-000951"
            >Hans Weisse</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000412">Oswald Jonas</ref>) and for publication
          of Schenker's writings, notably for the "Eroica" Symphony analysis for which he in fact
          paid 3,000 Marks in 1931 (diary, OJ 4/4, pp. 3623-3627, June 1, 6, 9, 12, 1931). In
          January-February 1933, he was in communication with <ref cRef="entity-000424">Ludwig
            Karpath</ref> about the possibility of an appointment for Schenker at the Vienna
          Akademie für Musik und darstellende Kunst (=Conservatory), and around the same time he
          strove to bring Schenker to Berlin to teach a masterclass in composition due to fall
          vacant in September 1933 (OC 18/37-38, December 10, 1932; diary OJ 4/6, p. 3817, March 2,
          1933), but this came to nothing with Hitler's installation as Reichskanzler on January 30,
          1933.</p>
        <p>However, Schenker became more critical of Furtwängler in the mid-1920s. Obviously deeming
          his successes to be too easily achieved, he accused him of superficial musical
          understanding, personal vanity, and greed for money (see eg diary, OJ 3/6, pp. 2578-2579,
          October 4, 1923). But aside from all the severe criticism, Schenker was aware of
          Furtwängler's outstanding talent, this double-edged assessment culminating in a remark
          uttered in his diary that it was "desolating to have to say that [Furtwängler] is and will
          be the premier conductor of our time!" (OJ 3/7, pp. 2808-2809, April 11, 1925). Although
          Furtwängler quit his post in Vienna in 1924, the two men stayed in regular contact,
          writing letters, and meeting whenever Furtwängler came to Austria.</p>
        <p>Their difficult acquaintance became ever more complicated in the early 1930s. Having read
          some articles by Furtwängler in the <ref cRef="neue_freie_presse"><title level="j">Neue
              Freie Presse</title></ref> (see Furtwängler's articles "Verkannte Wagner"and
          "Lebenskraft" [insert links]), Schenker sketched an extensive, enthusiastic letter to the
          conductor in November 1931, writing about the fundamentals of musical aesthetics, the
          decline of modern music, and ways to rescue musical culture (in which Furtwängler was to
          be involved by establishing a Vienna festival similar to that of Bayreuth or Salzburg),
          drawing analogies from the worlds of finance, film, and religion, and signaling his
          overall, far-reaching approval of Furtwängler's ideas (OJ 5/11, [1], vsn 1: November 13,
          1931; ibid., vsn 2: November 13, 1931). Written in the year of Furtwängler's financial
          support for <title level="j">Das Meisterwerk in der Musik</title>, vol. III, this letter
          marks the apogee of Schenker's esteem for Furtwängler and a period of intensive
          communication.</p>
        <p>Their relationship was, however, soon to be clouded by an incident from 1933: After
          Schenker had declined to give a speech for the Brahms centenary in Vienna (OJ 11/16, [12],
          September 22, 1932), he held it against Furtwängler that the latter plagiarized his ideas
          when the conductor himself delivered the address, <ref type="other" cRef="OC-B-452"><title
              level="a">Johannes Brahms</title></ref> (see e.g. OJ 4/6, p. 3833, May 16, 1933);
          Schenker's pupils seem to have confirmed him in his grievances. A severe inner rift
          resulted, though there is no evidence that Schenker ever took Furtwängler to task on this
          matter. On the other hand, the rise of the Nazi party and German anti-semitism did not
          have any direct effect on Furtwängler's private appraisal of Schenker. Although he decided
          not to publish an article on the theorist's works that he had for some time been planning
          to write and accepted the position of Vice-President of the Reichsmusikkammer, Schenker
          praised Furtwängler's behavior at the time of his conflict over Hindemith's music, which
          led to his resigning from all official posts.</p>
        <p>After Schenker's death, Furtwängler kept in touch with Jeannette Schenker until at least
          1937. In the later 1940s, he renewed contact with Oswald Jonas who helped him when
          Furtwängler was accused of Nazi allegiances. He finally published the long-awaited article
          on Schenker's theories in 1947, concentrating on the concept of <hi rend="italic"
            >Fernhören</hi> (distance-hearing) that doubtless influenced his way of perceiving and
          shaping music, but the text passed unnoticed in German music theory.</p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="bold">Correspondence with Schenker</hi>
        </p>
        <p>Extensive correspondence between Furtwängler and Heinrich Schenker extends from 1919 to
          1933, and survives as OJ 5/11, OJ 11/16, Sbb 55, Nachl 13, and OC 18/26, 37-38, 49-50, 55,
          59, OC 54/296, 299-301, that with Ludwig Karpath regarding Schenker as OC 18/27-28, 46-47,
          52 and OJ 35/4 and 71/11. Furtwängler corresponded with Moriz Violin (OJ 70/17, also
          70/68), Oswald Jonas (OJ 36/19, also 69/11), and with Hans Weisse, whose progress in the
          US he watched closely.</p>
