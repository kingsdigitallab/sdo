      <head>Felix Kornfeld</head>
      <div>
        <p>Son of <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jenny Kornfeld</ref> (<hi rend="italic">née</hi> Schiff;
          later Jeanette Schenker) and <ref cRef="entity-000466">Emil Kornfeld</ref>; business
          man.</p>

        <p>Felix was the younger son of <ref cRef="entity-000466">Emil Kornfeld</ref> and his wife
            <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jenny</ref> (later to be Jeanette Schenker), his elder brother
          being <ref cRef="entity-000467">Erich</ref>. Felix was born and brought up in <ref
            cRef="entity-002248">Aussig (Ústí nad Labem)</ref>. In a letter of 1926, <ref
            cRef="entity-000771">Jenny</ref>’s sister-in-law, <ref cRef="entity-000781">Anna
            Schiff</ref> wrote as follows (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-14-8_1">OJ 14/8,
            [1]</ref>, March 21, 1925): <cit>
            <q>I wanted to report to you what little I know about your two children. Yesterday we
              received a wedding announcement for your son <ref cRef="entity-000467">Erich</ref>,
              which I enclose. I gather that they have regard for you: <ref cRef="entity-000467"
                >Erich</ref> was obliged to enter the business of his father, Felix was for a long
              time a volunteer in <ref cRef="entity-002501">Berlin</ref>.</q>
          </cit></p>

        <p>Felix eventually followed his brother into his father's company, Klaber &amp; Kornfeld,
          traders in petroleum, oil and grease for industrial purposes. When <ref
            cRef="entity-000466">Emil</ref> died in 1937, <ref cRef="entity-000467">Erich</ref> and
          Felix continued the company until it ceased trading soon afterward. Felix suffered from a
          "lame foot" (<hi rend="italic">Fusslähmung</hi>), possibly from early in life.</p>

        <p>Felix married Elsa Wobornik (1906‒) on March 7, 1931, and the couple had a son, <ref
            cRef="entity-000469">Tomáš Kornfeld</ref> (“Tommy”), born August 7, 1932. In a letter of
          1934, <ref cRef="entity-000944">Rosa Weil</ref> gave her elder sister <ref
            cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette</ref> the following report: "Your sons both have pretty,
          likeable wives (non-Jews), and each has one splendid child: <ref cRef="entity-00046"
            >Erich</ref> has Peter, Felix has <ref cRef="entity-000469">Tommy</ref>" (<ref
            type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-14-10_15">OJ 14/10, [15]</ref>.</p>

        <p>Felix and <ref cRef="entity-000467">Erich</ref> ‒ neither of them observant Jews ‒ were
          arrested by the Gestapo on November 10, 1938 and taken to a concentration camp. Whereas
            <ref cRef="entity-000467">Erich</ref> was released six weeks later, Felix was held until
          May 31, 1939, on which date he was released conditional upon emigration. At about this
          time, "out of fear, and compelled by those around her," Elsa (who was not Jewish) divorced
          him. Felix wrote to his mother on August 23, 1939 (<ref type="correspondence"
            cRef="OJ-14-7_1">OJ 14/7, [1]</ref>), conveying this information and reporting his
          general state of mind, and asking for her help in finding a way to emigrate. She replied
          to him on September 1 and October 12, 1939, neither of which survives. He was later
          re-arrested by the Gestapo and taken to <ref cRef="entity-007490">Theresienstadt</ref>,
          where he encountered his <ref cRef="entity-000771">mother</ref> for the first and only
          time since 1910, before he was transferred to <ref cRef="entity-007493">Auschwitz</ref>,
          where he perished on November 15, 1944 (<ref cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette</ref> remained in
            <ref cRef="entity-007490">Theresienstadt</ref>, dying in January 1945).</p>

        <head>Felix Kornfeld and Heinrich Schenker</head>
        <p>Heinrich Schenker had been a close friend of <ref cRef="entity-000466">Emil
            Kornfeld</ref> since the early 1890s, apparently visiting the Kornfeld family in <ref
            cRef="entity-002248">Aussig</ref>, where he got to know <ref cRef="entity-000467"
            >Erich</ref> and Felix, as well as holidaying in the Alps with <ref cRef="entity-000466"
            >Emil</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000771">Jenny</ref> up to 1910, in which summer <ref
            cRef="entity-000771">Jenny</ref> left <ref cRef="entity-000466">Emil</ref> and her sons
          to be permanently with Heinrich in Vienna. Thereafter, all contact between <ref
            cRef="entity-000771">Jenny</ref> and the family was broken off by <ref
            cRef="entity-000466">Emil</ref>, and her name was "taboo" to the two sons (<ref
            type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-71-21a_2">OJ 71/21a, [2]</ref>).</p>
      </div>

        <head>Correspondence</head>
        <p>One letter from Felix to Jeanette survives as <ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-14-7_1"
            >OJ 14/7, [1]</ref> (1939). Summer vacation postcards to Felix from Schenker alone, or
          jointly with <ref cRef="entity-000466">Emil</ref>, or <ref cRef="entity-000771"
            >Jenny</ref>, or <ref cRef="entity-000467">Erich</ref>, from the Tyrol in the period
          1903-10, existed in 1988 in the possession of his son, <ref cRef="entity-000469">Tomáš
            Kornfeld</ref>; letters also existed at that time from <ref cRef="entity-000771"
            >Jenny</ref> to Felix, written on Felix's birthday in 1912 and 1917, at least the first
          of which went unanswered, and further letters in 1940-41 (reported in <ref
            type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-71-21a_2">OJ 71/21a, [2]</ref>).</p>
