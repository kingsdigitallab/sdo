      <head>Fritz (Friedrich) Wahle</head>
      <div>
        <p>Austrian violinist and violin teacher, second violinist of the Winkler String Quartet
          (1885–95), and a member of the Vienna Court Opera orchestra.</p>

        <head>Wahle and Schenker</head>

        <p>Wahle figures in Schenker's diary as early as 1903, as a member of the “<ref
            cRef="entity-000274">Gärtner</ref> Quartet” (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-6-4_23"
            >OJ 6/4, [23]</ref>, February 16, 1903), and again in 1906, when he is mentioned
          together with <ref cRef="entity-000274">Eduard Gärtner</ref> (p. 21) and 1907 (p. 35:
          "Evening: played with Fritz, etc. and <ref cRef="entity-000913">[Moriz] Violin</ref> at
          the <rs key="entity-003277" type="place">Rudolfinerhaus</rs>.") and p. 37 ("After quartet
          at <ref cRef="entity-000274">Eduard Gärtner</ref>'s, Kapellmeister <ref
            cRef="entity-003308">Kunwald</ref>, Fritz, and <ref cRef="entity-000913">Floriz</ref> in
          the coffee-house: discussion of Brahms's epigonism."). Schenker arranged for Wahle to
          receive a copy of each of his publications between 1903 and 1913, including both editions
          of <title level="m">Ein Beitrag zur Ornamentik</title>. Each one of these was duly
          acknowledged in long letters of gratitude, in which Wahle expressed his admiration of
          Schenker: for his enthusiasm, his insight into music, his seriousness of purpose, and his
          courage. Although none of these letters contains great insights into music, collectively
          they convey the impression of a thoughtful musician with an agreeable sense of humor.
          Wahle addresses Schenker with “Du,” a sign that they were on close terms; only one other
          corresponding friend, Moriz Violin, is known to have done the same.</p>

        <p>Until the autumn of 1906, Wahle was living with his brother <ref cRef="entity-000926"
            >Richard Wahle</ref>, university professor of philosophy, at Vienna I, Währingerstraße
          22. Thereafter he lived at Vienna I, Börsegasse 7.</p>

        <p>Schenker offers an encomium on his death: <cit>
            <q>Fritz Wahle has died! Even if in the specific sense of the word he is not to be
              ranked highly as a musician, he was driven by yearning for the highest standards,
              namely toward the example of [Joseph] Joachim, and that and his unusual literary
              education (fondness for Jean Paul [Richter]) gave him a particular stamp as a man,
              yes, something that can be called personality. On the basis of this he was able to
              enliven and stimulate every social gathering he attended. I myself stood in his debt
              for years of most happy experiences, for felicitous music-making, for memories of our
              delightful adventures and ultimately for my acquaintance with his <ref
                cRef="entity-000926">brother</ref>, the university professor, to whom my <ref
                cRef="entity-000319">sister</ref> in particular owes a great deal. (diary, pp.
              923-924, July 24, 1918)</q>
