        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Theodor Schreier was born in Vienna, the son of businessman Moritz Schreier (1844‒1922)
          and his wife Regina (1837‒1905). He studied at the Vienna Technische Hochschule 1891‒96,
          and from 1899 to 1906 worked as a partner in the architectural firm of Ernst Lindner and
          Theodor Schreier. After 1906 he set up independently, undertaking projects such as
          schools, synagogues, and office buildings as well as residential properties. His most
          important work was the synagogue in <ref cRef="entity-002340">Sankt Pölten</ref> which was
          built in 1912‒13. During World War I he served in the Austrian military construction
          command. Following the War, he worked in the technical division of the Austrian
          Creditanstalt Bankverein, becoming its head.</p>

        <p>Theodor married <ref cRef="entity-003403">Anna</ref> (<hi rend="italic">née</hi> Turnau,
          1878‒1942) c.1900. Their only child was <ref cRef="entity-007655">Otto</ref> (1901‒29),
          equally gifted in mathematics and music, who studied piano with Moriz Violin and Schenker
          himself (see below). After the tragically early death of <ref cRef="entity-007655"
            >Otto</ref> in 1929, Theodor effectively served as a father to <ref cRef="entity-007504"
            >Irene</ref> (daughter of <ref cRef="entity-007655">Otto</ref> and his wife <ref
            cRef="entity-007656">Edith</ref>), born in Vienna less than a month after <ref
            cRef="entity-007655">Otto</ref>'s death.</p>

        <p>It was probably due to <ref cRef="entity-003403">Anna</ref>’s ill-health that Theodor and
          she did not attempt to emigrate as <ref cRef="entity-007504">Irene</ref> and her <ref
            cRef="entity-007656">mother</ref> did after the annexation of Austria in 1938. In spite
          of later efforts to bring them out of then-Nazi Germany, the two were deported on October
          10, 1942 and both died in <ref cRef="entity-007490">Terezin (then Theresienstadt)</ref>
          concentration camp, <ref cRef="entity-003403">Anna</ref> shortly after arrival, and
          Theodor on January 22, 1943. Theodor was posthumously honored by the city of Vienna in a
          ceremony at the centenary of the construction of his <ref cRef="entity-002340">Sankt
            Pölten</ref> (now former) Synagogue.</p>

      <div>
        <head>Theodor Schreier and Schenker</head>
        <p>Theodor approached <ref cRef="entity-000632">Schenker</ref> on behalf of his <ref
            cRef="entity-007655">son</ref> on September 16, 1920. Subsequently Theodor and <ref
            cRef="entity-003403">Anna</ref> called on Schenker with <ref cRef="entity-007655"
            >Otto</ref>, when Schenker accepted <ref cRef="entity-007655">Otto</ref> provisionally
          as a pupil from October. In January 1921, Theodor asked Schenker for a continuation of
            <ref cRef="entity-007655">Otto</ref>'s tuition, "since his son is enjoying it greatly,"
          and this was evidently granted. Schenker wrote to Theodor on September 2, 1921, raising
          his fee for the coming year, at which point Theodor withdrew his son. The two men met once
          or twice thereafter according to Schenker's diary.</p>

      <div>
        <head>Correspondence</head>
        <p>Schenker's diary attests that there was correspondence between Theodor and Schenker, but
          none is known to survive.</p>
