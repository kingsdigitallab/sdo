      <head>Wilhelm Goldbaum (Dr.)</head>
      <div>
        <p> Person, unknown, whose name Schenker gives to the publisher <ref cRef="entity-002405">J. G. Cotta</ref> as someone who
          will write on his behalf (CA 1-2, November 8, 1905). In 1906, Goldbaum is mentioned twice
          in Schenker's diary in connection with his <title level="m">Harmonielehre</title>:
          "Evening, sound advice received from Dr. Goldbaum concerning the title and final chapter"
          (September 21), "Establishment of title with the help of Dr. Goldbaum and [Adalbert] <ref cRef="entity-000819">Seligmann</ref>" (October 9) (OJ 1/5, pp. 20, 22). </p>
        <p>Since the final chapter of <title level="m">Harmonielehre</title>, "The Teaching of
          Modulation and Preludizing," includes a "Critique of Present-day Teaching Methods," in
          which "theorists and music pedagogues (in their textbooks as well as monographs)" are
          disparaged for their treatment of modulation and preludizing in too abstract a manner, and
          a harmonic plan from Salomon Jadassohn's <title level="m">Art of Modulating and
            Preludizing</title> (Leipzig: Breitkopf &amp; Härtel, 1890) (of which Schenker owned
          a copy) is singled as an instance of this, and since the title-page involved Schenker's
          concealing his identity under the pseudonym "an artist," it is possible that Goldbaum was
          serving as a legal adviser with a view to the law of libel.</p>
