      <head>Woodrow Wilson</head>
      <div>
        <p>Idealist President of the United States 1913-21, who brought America into the war against
          the Central Powers in 1917, issuing his "Fourteen Points" on January 8, 1918 to give
          assurances to the world regarding the aims of the war, and which formed the basis of the
          German surrender. Wilson played a major role in the Versailles Treaty as a member of the
          "Council of Four" (with <ref cRef="entity-000134">George Clémenceau</ref>, <ref cRef="entity-000534">David Lloyd George</ref>, and <ref cRef="entity-000645">Emanuele Orlando</ref>), and was the primary instigator in 1919 of the League of
          Nations.</p>

        <head>Schenker's Attitude toward Wilson</head>
        <p>Schenker, in his lead article to <title level="j">Der Tonwille</title>, Heft 1, <title level="a">Von der Sendung des deutschen Genies</title> (The Mission of German Genius),
          spoke of "that living incarnation of mendacity Woodrow Wilson," declaring "he must surely
          be named for all time as third alongside Ephialtes and Judas" (p. 6; Eng. trans., vol. I,
          p. 7), and characterizing the Versailles and St. Germain Treaties as "synonymous with
          ultimate moral depravity, filthy mendaciousness, unparalleled incompetence, crassest
          ignorance, betrayal of human rights, trickery by blackmail, and theft of private property,
          not to mention loutish personal behavior" (pp. 6-7/7). He asked rhetorically: "Is a
          manicured Wilson any bit worthier that an unmanicured German man of honor?" (p. 11/11).
          The "Fourteen Points," he said, are "designed solely to sway opinion in the army and in
          the Russian and German hinterland, and in no sense for the greater good of man kind"
          (p.15/15), denouncing them as " full of imperialist ideas in the guise of democracy-speak"
          (OJ 2/10, p. 827, January 10, 1918).</p>
