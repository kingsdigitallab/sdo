      <head>(Julius August) Philipp Spitta</head>
      <div>

        <p>German music historian, conductor, and composer.</p>

        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Spitta studied theology and classical philology at the University of Göttingen 1860‒64.
          After a period as a school teacher his principal interest became research into the life
          and work of J. S. Bach. He published the first volume of his two-volume biography <title
            level="m">Johann Sebastian Bach</title> in 1873. In 1875 he was appointed professor of
          music history at the University of Berlin, and in the same year administrative director of
          the Berlin Hochschule für Musik. He published the second volume of the Bach biography in
          1880. He edited music of Buxtehude, Schütz, and Frederick of Prussia, and he wrote on many
          other subjects, his research interests ranging from the middle ages to the 19th century.
          He accumulated a large circle of students in whom he instilled the principles of scholarly
          musicology. He retained both of his Berlin positions until his death at the age of 52.
          With Chrysander and Adler, he is now seen as one of the founders of the discipline of
          German musicology.</p>

        <head>Spitta and Schenker</head>
        <p>In the commentary to his edition of J. S. Bach's <title level="m">Chromatic Fantasy and
            Fugue</title> (1910), p. 19 (Eng. transl., p. 24), Schenker took Spitta to task for
          characterizing the Fantasy as "all uncontrolled 'storm and stress'" and so failing to see
          the simple tonal motion underlying it. Fourteen years later he had a similar criticism: in
          "J. Seb. Bach: Matthäuspassion Rezitativ: "Erbarm es Gott" (<title level="j"
            >Tonwille</title> 7 (IV/1) (January‒March 1924), 34‒38, ref. 37 (Eng. transl., pp.
          67‒68), he chided Spitta for relying on notational appearance rather than tonal effect. In
          his study of Bach's Partita No. 3 for solo violin in <title level="j">Meisterwerk</title>
          1 (1925), 85‒88 (Eng. transl., pp. 47‒48), he was highly critical of Spitta on several
          accounts ("he does not come even close to the purely musical content of the piece"). In
          keeping with this, in a letter of January 18, 1915 (WSLB 236), he grouped Spitta with the
          "hermeneuticists" that he so despised.</p>
