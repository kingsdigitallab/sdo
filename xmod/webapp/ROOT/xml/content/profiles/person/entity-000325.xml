      <head>Richard Haldane</head>
      <div>

        <p>British politician, lawyer, and philosopher, initially member of the Liberal Party, who
          was Secretary of State for War 1905–12, and Lord Chancellor 1912–15 and, after joining the
          Labour party in 1923, Lord Chancellor again in 1924. From 1911, he was First Viscount
          Haldane.</p>

        <p>Haldane implemented what are known as the "Haldane Reforms," which were aimed at
          preparing the British army for a European war. He was also instrumental in building up the
          British aircraft industry by creating the Advisory Committee on Aeronautics in 1909.</p>

        <p>Haldane wrote several philosophical works, and co-translated Schopenhauer's <title level="m">The World as Will and Representation</title> (1883–86).</p>
