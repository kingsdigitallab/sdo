      <div>
        <p>Pupil of Schenker's for four seasons, 1918/19 to 1921/22, studying the solo piano
          repertory and also counterpoint in up to at least three voices.</p>
        <p>Schaab is first mentioned in Schenker's diary on September 3, 1918 inquiring about
          tuition, and was accepted by Schenker for the season beginning October 1 that year, taking
          in some seasons two lessons a week, in others one, depending on her finances – she had
          pupils of her own, with the fees from whom she funded her studies with Schenker. On April
          7, 1919 she asked to reduce to only two lessons a month, which Schenker refused. On May
          16, 1922 she announced her engagement to be married, and on June 19 she left Schenker. In
          the diary for October 1924 she is referred to as "Frau Kurt-Schaab."</p>
