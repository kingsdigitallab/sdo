      <div>

        <p>Member of the German Freikorps (German paramilitary force) after World War I. </p>

        <p>During World War I, Schlageter was a voluntary emergency worker with the German army, and
          served at Ypres, the Somme, and Verdun, earning the Iron Cross. After the war, he joined
          the Freikorps, and took part in activities against the communist revolutionaries. In 1922,
          became associated with the recently formed Nazi Party. During the French occupation of the
          Ruhr in 1923, he led a unit sabotaging the French occupying forces, and for this he was
          court-martialled by the French and executed on May 26, 1923. </p>

        <p>Schlageter subsequently became a martyr in the eyes of German nationalists. Hitler
          referred to him in <title level="m">Mein Kampf</title>, and he was revered by the Nazi
          regime as a national hero. </p>
