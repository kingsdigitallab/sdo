      <head>Karl (Karli) [Schimatowitsch]</head>
      <div>

        <p>Possibly the younger son of <ref cRef="entity-000895">Anton (Tonschl)
            Schimatowitsch</ref>, grandson of <ref cRef="entity-0008443">Mrs. Schimatowitsch</ref>,
          hence “adoptive” grandson of <ref cRef="entity-000775">Wilhelm Schenker</ref>, and thus an
          “adoptive” grand nephew of Heinrich Schenker; younger brother of <ref cRef="entity-003491"
            >Anton (Tonerl) Schimatowitsch</ref>.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Identity</head>
        <p>The name “Karli” appears four times in Schenker’s diary for 1925–1926, and seven times in
          Heinrich’s correspondence with his elder brother <ref cRef="entity-000775">Wilhelm</ref>
          between 1925 and 1934. The surname “Schimatowitsch” is nowhere used in the Schenker
          papers; the grounds for identification are set out in the profile <ref
            cRef="entity-000895">Anton (Tonschl) Schimatowitsch</ref>. The remainder of this profile
          is predicated on that identification.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Life Summary</head>
        <p>Karli was baptized in <ref cRef="entity-002340">St. Pölten</ref> on July 24, 1911, the
          second child of “<ref cRef="entity-000895">Tonschl</ref>” and his unknown wife, whose
          death, as reported by his older brother <ref cRef="entity-003491">Tonerl</ref>, is
          recorded in Heinrich’s diary for January 10, 1921. After their mother’s death and that of
            <ref cRef="entity-000767">Dodi Schenker</ref> in 1923, <ref cRef="entity-000775"
            >Wilhelm</ref> took primary responsibility for the upbringing of the two boys, with
          Heinrich advising, and younger brother <ref cRef="entity-000774">Moriz Schenker</ref> (who
          died in 1936) and wife <ref cRef="entity-003438">Lisl</ref> supporting financially.</p>

        <p>Nothing is known of Karli’s childhood or schooling other than that he and <ref
            cRef="entity-003491">Tonerl</ref> had mumps in 1918 when living in the household of <ref
            cRef="entity-000775">Wilhelm</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000767">Dodi Schenker</ref>,
          where they were called “the children” (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-5-38_1">OJ
            5/38, [1]</ref>, January 24, 1918); but at the age of 13 he is reported as displaying a
          talent for drawing, in reaction to which Heinrich suggested a possible career as a
          commercial artist, at the same time voicing the possibility of a military career (diary,
          February 2, 1925; <ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-5-38_16">OJ 5/38, [16]</ref>,
          February 3, 1925). Later in 1925 he is said to be “well-placed” (<ref
            type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-5-38_21">OJ 5/38, [21]</ref>, September 14, 1925),
          without further clarification. In 1934 Heinrich inquired whether Karli and <ref
            cRef="entity-003491">Tonerl</ref> had been caught up in the Austrian civil uprising of
          mid-February (<ref type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-5-38_87">OJ 5/38, [87]</ref>, April 15,
          1934).</p>

        <p>There is no further information until late 1934, when Karli is described as a
          lance-corporal in the “Flying Division” (branch of service unspecified – <ref
            type="correspondence" cRef="OC-A-296">OC A/296</ref>, December 24, 1934). He died on
          February 10, 1946, and his body is buried in the War Grave Section of St. Severin
          Cemetery, Am Severinstor 9, 94032 Passau, Bavaria, Germany.</p>
