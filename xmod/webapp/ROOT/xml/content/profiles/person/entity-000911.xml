      <head>Genoveva [Eva; Everl; Evchen] Violin [Mädi]</head>

      <div>
        <p>Daughter of <ref cRef="entity-000913">Moriz</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000914">Valerie
            Violin</ref>. Genoveva had a brother, <ref cRef="entity-000912">Karl</ref>.</p>

        <head>Life Summary</head>
        <p>Despite Moriz Violin's describing her once as a "five-year-old virtuosa" at the piano,
          Genoveva was not particularly active in music, albeit surrounded by music at home. She is
          frequently referred to in the correspondence between the Violins and the Schenkers. With
          the family, she lived first in Vienna, then moved to Hamburg, returning to Vienna in 1933
          as the anti-Semitic campaign began in Germany. </p>

        <p>The family emigrated to San Francisco c. May 1939, but Genoveva was apparently in the
          Netherlands at the time and did not join the family in San Francisco until March 1940. She
          became a dress designer, with her own shop in Los Angeles. She later married, becoming Eva
          Violin-Windsor, and raised two adopted children (Steven and Diana).</p>

        <head>Correspondence</head>

        <p>One postcard probably from Genoveva Violin to Heinrich and Jeanette Schenker exists as OJ
          14/46, [A], filed with the <ref cRef="entity-000909">Fanny Violin</ref> correspondence. A
          letter to her from <ref cRef="entity-007660">Willem Mengelberg</ref> exists as <ref
            type="correspondence" cRef="OJ-70-26_1">OJ 70/26, [1]</ref>, June 23, 1938, in response
          to an appeal from her for support for her father in America.</p>
