      <head>General Johann von Kiesling</head>
      <div>

        <p>Bavarian nobleman, and soldier, later a Brigadier General in the Chilean army.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Johann von Kiesling was born in Munich, attended military school there in the 1890s
          rising to the rank of Full Lieutenant, and qualified to join the General Staff. In 1910 he
          was given leave to serve as an instructor in Argentina, but an encounter with an official
          of the Chilean army in Berlin persuaded him instead to join the General Staff of that army
          as a Full Lieutenant from 1911 to 1914, in which year he returned to Bavaria as a Major in
          an infantry regiment, serving in World War I in the Middle East. In 1924 he returned to
            <ref cRef="entity-005845">Chile</ref>, where he acted first as an instructor at the War
          Academy. He was promoted to Brigadier General in 1933, retiring in 1937. — He had one son
          and four daughters.</p>

        <p><ref cRef="entity-000771">Jeanette Schenker</ref>, during her travels to Chile in 1936,
          met the General, his son, <ref rend="entity-008478">Hans Richard</ref>, and
          daughter-in-law, <ref cRef="entity-008479">Elfie (Elfride) von Kiesling</ref>, and visited
          his home in <ref cRef="entity-008467">Santiago</ref>, and his large country estate in the
          mountains outside that city.</p>
