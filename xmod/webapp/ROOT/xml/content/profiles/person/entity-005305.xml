      <div>

        <p>Austrian violinist, conductor and composer.</p>

        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Son of Josef Hellmesberger, sen., the founder of the Hellmesberger String Quartet, Josef
          Hellmesberger, jun. made his name first as a solo violinist. By 1878 he was a violinist
          with the Vienna court band and the Court Opera, and from that year to 1902 he was a
          professor of violin at the Vienna Conservatory. In 1891 he succeeded his father as the
          first violin of the String Quartet.</p>

        <p>After several minor conducting positions, he was appointed chief conductor at the Vienna
          court in 1890. He first conducted the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra in 1900, and became
          its principal conductor in succession to Gustav Mahler in 1901, scandal forcing him to
          resign from that position in 1903 and later from his court appointment. Only success as an
          operetta composer thereafter saved him from ruin.</p>

      <div>
        <head>Hellmesberger and Schenker</head>
        <p>There was brief contact between the two men in 1903, when Schenker was submitting a work
          of his for tryout by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. Nothing seems to have come from
          this, perhaps because Hellmesberger's enforced resignation intervened. One letter from
          Hellmesberger to Schenker survives (OJ 11/46, [1], Sept 22, 1903).</p>
