      <head>Trude Kral</head>
      <div>

        <p>Pupil of Hans Weisse and Heinrich Schenker. </p>

        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>In Vienna, Trude Kral was a piano pupil of Anka Bernstein Landau, the assistant of <ref
            cRef="entity-000718">Richard Robert</ref>. She emigrated to the United States, where she
          joined the piano faculty of the Third Street Music School in New York.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Kral and Schenker</head>
        <p>Trude Kral studied with <ref cRef="entity-000951">Hans Weisse</ref> from probably as
          early as 1924 (when under his encouragement she took out a subscription to Schenker's
            <title level="j">Der Tonwille</title>: OC 52/651). In 1925 she was living on the
          Langegasse, in the 8th district of Vienna (Josefstadt). After Weisse's emigration to the
          United States in summer 1931, she became a member of Schenker's "Friday seminar" with <ref
            cRef="entity-002498">Greta Kraus</ref>, <ref cRef="entity-000754">Felix Salzer</ref>,
          and <ref cRef="entity-000964">Manfred Willfort</ref>. In Schenker's informal notes on the
          1931/32 season of the seminar (OC 16/39‒42), she is mentioned specifically in connection
          with the J. S. Bach C-major Prelude, <title level="m">Well-tempered Clavier</title>, Book
          I, which would later appear as the first item of the <title level="m">Fünf
            Urlinie-Tafeln</title> (1932). </p>

        <p>As to the 1932/33 season, a conversation between Kral and Schenker is recorded in the
          latter's diary at OJ 4/5, p. 3775, September 22, 1932, which Schenker reported to Salzer
          in a letter of the same date (FS 40/1, [13]), concerning seminar plans for the new season.
          Kral did not attend the opening meetings, and finally gave notice of withdrawal on
          November 7 (OJ 4/6, p. 3789). </p>
        
        <p>There is no known surviving correspondence between Kral and Schenker.</p>
