        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Like Schenker (who was also born in Galicia), he was educated in Lemberg (L'vov, L'viv),
          and like him studied piano with Chopin's pupil and assistant Karol Mikuli (from 1872). He
          moved to Vienna with his family in 1875, continuing his piano studies with Rafael Joseffy.
          He took private lessons with Liszt in Weimar and Rome for nine years. At this time, he
          retired from music to study philosophy and aesthetics at Vienna University 1878-84, taking
          courses with, among others, Eduard Hanslick and <ref cRef="entity-000003">Guido
            Adler</ref>. He emigrated to the USA in 1938, living in New York.</p>

        <head>Rosenthal and Schenker</head>
        <p>Despite both men having been in Lemberg, it is unlikely that they met there, since
          Schenker probably did not enter Lemberg Gymnasium until 1877, two years after Rosenthal
          left for Vienna. It is more likely that they met at Vienna University c. 1884. Their
          surviving correspondence begins in 1894, when Rosenthal was already addressing Schenker as
          "Dear Sir and Friend." On November 10, 1912, Rosenthal wrote to Schenker to say that he
          had heard nothing more of Schenker's planned <ref cRef="organization_artists"
            >"Organization for Creative and Performing Artists"</ref> (OJ 13/29, [9], quoted
          Federhofer).</p>

        <head>Correspondence with Schenker</head>
        <p>Correspondence from Rosenthal to Schenker is preserved as OJ 13/29 (1894-1912: 12 items),
          and one draft letter from Moriz Violin to Rosenthal survives as OJ 70/3 (undated).</p>
