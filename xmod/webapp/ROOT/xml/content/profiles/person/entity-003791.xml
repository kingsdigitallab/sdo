      <head>Marcus [Markus] Schenker</head>
      <div>

        <p>The first-born child of <ref cRef="entity-000772">Johann</ref> and <ref
            cRef="entity-000773">Julia Schenker</ref>; Heinrich Schenker's eldest sibling.</p>

        <p>Marcus ‒ popular German equivalent of the Hebrew name Mordecai (who in the post-Biblical
          book of Esther played a heroic role in saving the Jews from annihilation by King Ahasuerus
          and his adviser, Haman) ‒ was born in 1859. (His birth record gives <ref
            cRef="entity-002401">Lemberg</ref>, "building number 225, town center" ‒ but this may be
          the place of registration, rather than birth, which perhaps took place in <ref
            cRef="entity-002333">Wisniowczyk</ref>, where the family lived).</p>

        <p>Nothing is now known of his life.</p>

        <p>Marcus died in 1879 (town record <ref cRef="entity-002401">Lemberg</ref>), while <ref
            cRef="entity-000772">Johann</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-000773">Julia</ref> were still
          alive and was buried in Lemberg cemetery. The evidence for this comes from a diary entry
          of September 13, 1923, where, in lamenting his <ref cRef="entity-000773">mother</ref>'s
          burial so far away from the surviving children, he specifies: "My brother [Marcus] in
          Lemberg, my father in <ref cRef="entity-004091">Podhajce</ref>, my eldest sister [Rebecka]
          unknown, and now my mother here [in <ref cRef="entity-002323">Waidhofen</ref>]." (His
          grave has not been found.) Two later diary entries recall the burial, but are actually
          about his other elder brother, <ref cRef="entity-000775">Wilhelm</ref>, rather than Marcus
          himself: <cit>
            <q>September 3, 1927: [Wilhelm] no longer remembers the evening on which we left our
              father in Lemberg after the burial of our eldest brother and, returning to our
              lodging, shook hands and hugged each other – he doesn't remember our brother, not even
              his death!</q>
          </cit>
          <cit>
            <q>January 29, 1930: But of course [Wilhelm] also does not remember that evening when we
              finally left our parents, who had buried their eldest son, and returned home to our
              student accommodation. I [...] extended my little hand to him, in order to bond most
              intimately with the brother who was walking beside me, after we had lost our eldest
              brother. It came to me from my heart, from the will to love – but even of this moment,
              too, my brother has no recollection whatever!</q>
