        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>San Francisco-born Ada Clement studied piano with well-known piano teachers including
          Oscar Weil, and then studied in Europe between 1909 and 1920 with Josef Lh√©vinne and <ref
            cRef="entity-005307">Harold Bauer</ref>. In 1917 with Lillian Hodghead she cofounded the
          Ada Clement Piano School, which in 1923 was renamed the <ref cRef="entity-007670">San
            Francisco Conservatory of Music</ref>, in which she taught and served as co-director
          until 1925. After five years in which Ernest Bloch served as director, Hodghead and
          Clement resumed their co-directorship until 1951, after which they were succeeded by <ref
            cRef="entity-007665">Albert Elkus</ref>.</p>

        <head>Ada Clement and Moriz Violin</head>
        <p>In 1939 <ref cRef="entity-007498">Alfred V. Frankenstein</ref> gave Schenker's closest
          friend <ref cRef="entity-000913">Moriz Violin</ref>, by which time the latter had migrated
          from Vienna and settled in <ref cRef="entity-002921">San Francisco</ref>, letters of
          recommendation to a number of people, including Ada Clement, whom he described as "one
          very neat lady." Clement introduced Violin to <ref cRef="entity-007500">Hans Barkan</ref>,
          who endeavored to help Violin in finding work, and invited him to play chamber music.</p>
