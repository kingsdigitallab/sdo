      <head>Albert Schweitzer</head>
      <div>
        <p>Alsatian organist, writer on music, especially that of J. S. Bach, also theologian,
          philosopher, and medical doctor.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Schweitzer studied organ playing under Widor in Paris, and music theory under Heinrich
          Bellermann in Strasbourg. He was a crucial figure in the new movement toward historical
          organ building in the early 20th century, with an important article presented to the
          Internationale Musikgesellschaft (International Music Society) in 1909. He spent much of
          his life from 1913 on at the missionary hospital that he founded in Lambaréné,
          in Africa. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1952.</p>
        <p>His best-known book on music is <title level="m">J. S. Bach, le
          musicien-poète</title> (Leipzig, 1905); German translation, greatly enlarged, as
            <title level="m">J. S. Bach</title> (1908). This work is much concerned with
          interpretation and issues of authentic performance. Schweitzer also, with others, produced
          a complete edition of Bach's organ works (1912-14, 1954-67).</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Schweitzer and Schenker</head>
        <p>Schenker knew Schweitzer's book in the German translation (a copy of the 1922 edition of
          which was in his private library at his death), and quoted from it not infrequently: in
            <title level="j">Der Tonwille</title> Heft 5, p. 27 (Eng. trans., I, 165-66), in
          relation to Bach's practice of copying the works of other, lesser composers; in his own
          essay on the opening chorus of the <title level="m">St. Matthew Passion</title> in <title level="j">Der Tonwille</title> Heft 10 = IV/4, p. 10 (II, 133-34), on the interpretation
          of that chorus; in his own essay on the Prelude to Bach's solo violin Partita No. 3 in E
          major in <title level="j">Das Meisterwerk in der Musik</title>, vol. I, pp. 88-92 (Eng.
          trans., I, 48-50); and he mentions him in passing in vol. III, p. 14 (III, 3). In these
          passages he expresses agreement with much of what Schweitzer says, taking issue with him
          at the same time. Schenker kept six newspaper clippings of articles about Schweitzer from
          between 1923 and 1928 (OC 12/20; C/3, 116, 500, 504, 505).</p>
        <p>There is no known correspondence between Schenker and Schweitzer.</p>
