        <p>Progressive boarding school, and also journal produced by the school's associates.</p>
        
        <p>Founded in 1906 by the educational reformer Gustav Wyneken (1875-1964), together with
          Paul Geheeb, August Halm, and Martin Luserke, who styled themselves "pedagogical rebels,"
          the school was located in Wickersdorf, a village in the Thuringen Forest 40 miles (65 km)
          south of Weimar. Its curriculum was centered on the concept of "objective spirit," and
          stressed intellectual and artistic pursuits. Part of the wider "reform pedagogy" movement
          of the time in Germany arising out of the Wilhelmine charge to reform education, and in
          Europe more broadly, it stood against the tendency toward nationalistic (<hi rend="italic">völkisch</hi>) education then current.</p>
        
        <p>Music occupied a privileged place in this curriculum, its musical program created by
          August Halm (one of Schenker's correspondents), who taught at the Wickersdorf from 1906 to
          1910, and again 1920-29.</p>
        
        <p>The name <hi rend="italic">Freie Schulgemeinde</hi> was also given to a journal produced
          by those associated with the school, and published by Eugen Diederichs of Jena.</p>
