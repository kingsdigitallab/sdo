      <div>
        <p>Public radio company established in February 1924. It was a joint venture of the Austrian
          federal government, the City of Vienna, and several banks. Its radio transmissions began
          on October 1, 1924, and featured classical music, literature, and lectures. From 1925 it
          began live broadcasts from opera houses and concert halls; live sports broadcasts began in
          1928. The company was dissolved soon after the Anschluß in March 1938.</p>

        <p>Schenker approached RAVAG through <ref cRef="entity-002756">Dr. Richtera</ref>, Director
          of Programs, to have <ref cRef="entity-000380">Hoboken</ref>'s <ref cRef="entity-002418"
            >Appeal</ref> for support for the <ref cRef="entity-002452">Photogramm Archive</ref> to
          be read out by <ref cRef="entity-000164">Otto Erich Deutsch</ref>. The result of this
          negotiation was the publication in RAVAG's magazine, <title level="j">Radio-Wien</title>,
          January 27, 1928, of an article about the Archive by <ref cRef="entity-000320">Robert
            Haas</ref>, a copy of which is preserved as OC2/p. 74.</p>

        <p>Heinrich and Jeanette Schenker acquired their first radio set in October 1924, and from
          that point on documented what they listened to in detail in his diaries. The radio gave
          them an entrée into genres of music, from popular music and jazz to contemporary opera,
          that they would not have chosen to attend live. They also listened to plays, readings,
          talks, and lectures.</p>
