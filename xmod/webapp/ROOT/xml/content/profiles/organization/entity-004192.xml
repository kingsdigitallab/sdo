      <head>Wiener Tonkünstler-Orchester</head>
      <div>
        <p>Independent professional orchestra in Vienna 1907‒32, revived after World War Two.</p>

        <p>The Tonkünstler Orchestra was established with 83 musicians in 1907 by Oskar Nedbal as a
          free-standing professional orchestra dedicated to concert performance (as against the <ref
            cRef="entity-003235">Vienna Philharmonic</ref>, which was also tied to the Vienna Court
          Opera (= State Opera). (There was no institutional connection between the orchestra and
          the <ref cRef="entity-003303">Wiener Tonkünstler-Verein</ref> (Vienna Musicians'
          Association), founded in 1885.) It gave its first concert on October 10, 1907 in the
          Musikverein Building, under the batons of Oskar Nedbal, Hans Pfitzner, and Bernhard
          Stavenhagen.</p>

        <p>The orchestra was conducted by Nedbal until 1919, then by <ref cRef="entity-000268"
            >Wilhelm Furtwängler</ref> to 1923, then by Rudolf Nilius. In 1913 with the Philharmonic
          Chorus it gave the first performance of <ref cRef="entity-000798">Schoenberg</ref>'s
            <title level="m">Gurre-Lieder</title>, under the baton of <ref cRef="entity-000802"
            >Franz Schreker</ref>. In 1933 it was merged with the Vienna Concert Society (<hi
            rend="italic">Wiener Konzertverein</hi>) Orchestra under the latter name.</p>

        <p>The name was appropriated under the National Socialists between 1933 and 1944. The
          orchestra was revived in 1946 and continues to the present day, based in Vienna and <ref
            cRef="entity-002340">Sankt Pölten</ref>.</p>

      <div>
        <head>The Tonkünstler-Orchester and Schenker</head>
        <p>Schenker's diary does not record his having attended the first performance by the
          orchestra, but he did attend two weeks later, writing: "The Tonkünstler Orchestra under
          Stavenhagen garbles Schubert's B minor Symphony." Also, on March 12, 1908: "<ref
            cRef="entity-000732">Rosenthal</ref> with the Tonkünstler Orchestra [...] plays the <hi
            rend="italic">potpouris</hi> Piano Concerto in B-flat minor by Tchaikovsky. What
          superficiality, what a childish way of stretching out the content and of modulating ‒
          [...] only naive, utterly naive art, although in terms of invention there is so much that
          might be called beautiful."</p>

        <p>It is unclear in which years Schenker subscribed to the orchestra's series. His diary for
          October 21, 1912 records: "As the program booklet of the Tonkünstler concerts indicates,
          Vienna is taking no notice of my account of the <ref cRef="entity-001731"><title level="m"
              >Ninth Symphony</title></ref>," which suggests that he may have subscribed for the
          1912/13 season; there is no doubt that he subscribed in 1920/21; and on November 28, 1921,
          evidently for the 1921/22 season, Heinrich complained that the subscription had undergone
          an "increase of 100%").</p>
