      <div>
        <p>Schenker's study of Beethoven's Symphony No. 3 in E<g type="flat"/> major ("Eroica"),
          which at one stage Schenker envisioned as a monograph publication, by <ref
            cRef="entity-002408">Universal Edition</ref>, but which was ultimately published by <ref
            cRef="entity-002627">Drei Masken Verlag</ref> as part of volume III of <title level="j"
            >Das Meisterwerk in der Musik</title> (1930) with the title <title level="a">Beethovens
            Dritte Sinfonie zum erstenmal in ihrem wahren Inhalt dargestellt</title> [Beethoven's
          Third Symphony for the first time portrayed in its true content].</p>

          <p>Schenker wrote to <ref cRef="entity-000356">Emil Hertzka</ref> on November 27, 1928
            (WSLB 400 ‒ the first contact between the two men since December 1925) proposing that
            the study of the "Eroica" Symphony on which he had been working be published by
            Universal Edition "as supplementing the <hi rend="italic">Ninth</hi> [<hi rend="italic"
              >Symphony</hi>] and the <hi rend="italic">Fifth Symphony</hi>" ‒ that is, he wished to
            see UE fabricate <hi rend="italic">retrospectively</hi> a series comprising his
            monograph <ref cRef="entity-001731"><bibl><title level="m">Beethovens Neunte
                  Sinfonie</title> (1912)</bibl></ref>, his three-part study of the Fifth Symphony
              (<title level="j">Tonwille</title> 1921‒23) subsequently assembled in monograph form
            as <ref cRef="entity-001760"><bibl><title level="m">Beethovens Fünfte Sinfonie</title>
                (1925)</bibl></ref>, and his new study of the Third Symphony (which he predicted
            would comprise "at most 2-3 gatherings in length plus Urlinie graphs"). While Hertzka
            agreed to entertain the possibility in principle (OC 52/847), he prevaricated throughout
            1929, and in January 1930 (OC 52/860) stated that economic conditions still made it
            "impossible at this time." Thereafter a six-month silence ensued on both sides.</p>

          <p><ref cRef="entity-000913">Moriz Violin</ref> wrote to the Berlin publisher Rather about
            the monograph, but in January 1930 received a discouraging response (OJ 14/45, [84]).
            Subequently, <ref cRef="entity-000866">Karl Straube</ref> made approaches to <ref
              cRef="entity-002890">Breitkopf &amp; Härtel</ref> and <ref cRef="entity-002422">C. F.
              Peters</ref>, but these met with no interest (OC 54/218). In February, costings were
            sought and received direct from <ref cRef="entity-002402">Waldheim-Eberle</ref> in
            Vienna (OC 54/221).</p>

          <p>Schenker wrote to Drei Masken Verlag (referred to in OC 54/233) on March 16, 1930,
            after a two-year break in correspondence, to inquire about conditions for a third volume
            of <title level="j">Das Meisterwerk</title>. DMV on May 22, 1930 declared its
            willingness "to undertake the third volume of Dr. Schenker's <title level="m"
              >Yearbook</title> in the manner proposed by you" (OC 54/224). With this the monograph
            proposal, and the imagined UE monograph series, lapsed.</p>
