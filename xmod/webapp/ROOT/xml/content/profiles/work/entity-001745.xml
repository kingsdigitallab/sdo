        <p>The sixth issue of Schenker's periodical <ref cRef="entity-001739">
            <title level="j">Der Tonwille</title>
          </ref> (1921–24).</p>
        <div>

          <p>Issue 6, 48 pages in length, focuses on two composers: Schubert and Beethoven.</p>
          <p>It marks the long deferred completion of the study of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony,
            covering the third and fourth movements, each treated analytically and as to source
            study and performance, the article concluding with a survey of the secondary literature
            for the second, third, and fourth movements. </p>
          <p>The recent publication of a facsimile of the autograph manuscript and first edition of
            Schubert's song "Gretchen at the Spinning Wheel" (in a series to which Schenker had
            himself contributed) was the impetus for the Schubert focus. In the opening article,
            Schenker compares the two sources, in a study which gives insight into an important
            aspect of his teaching: the evaluation of the sources of a piece of music. Schubert is
            also the subject of three of the four sections of the "Miscellanea" (which is shorter
            and less political than previous miscellanies), including a brief examination of
            Schubert's handling of another Goethe poem (this containing a brief, but poignant,
            recollection of the Dutch baritone <ref cRef="entity-000592">Johannes
            Messchaert</ref> (died September 1922), who had engaged Schenker as an accompanist on a
            concert tour in 1899), and a reprimand ("Genius and State") to commerce and state for
            failing to recognize the capital asset that Schubert represents.</p>
          <p>The issue also includes an exploration of the nature of freedom in musical performance.
