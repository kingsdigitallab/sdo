      <head>Die Kunst des Vortrags</head>
      <div>
        <p>Unpublished work of Schenker, first drafted in 1911, though possibly conceived in 1906,
          and reworked at several later times.</p>

        <p><title level="m">Die Kunst des Vortrags</title> was compiled in the summer of 1911, while
          on vacation: diary entry, July 1, 1911 (OJ 1/10, p. 135b): "A start made on the work
            <title level="m">The Art of Performance</title>", and July 13, 1911 (p. 135a): <title
            level="m">The Art of Performance</title> put into order for the first time, right down
          to the last few slips of paper. (Provisionally!)." Schenker also wrote to <ref
            cRef="entity-000356">Emil Hertzka</ref> of <ref cRef="entity-002408">Universal
            Edition</ref> ten days later: "It may perhaps interest you to learn that I have
          completed a short text, <title level="m">The Art of Performance</title>, while here, which
          I intend to publish separately at some stage in the future" (WSLB 78). And in the Preface
          of his <ref cRef="entity-001731"><title level="m">Beethovens Neunte Sinfonie</title></ref>
          of 1912, Schenker referred to "a monograph 'Die Kunst des Vortrags' to be published in the
          foreseeable future" (p. XII, Eng. transl., p. 8).</p>

        <p>However, marginal notes in the diary for 1906 suggest that Schenker may have conceived
          the work five years earlier than this. Beside entries on December 6 and 12 describing
          performances of works of Beethoven by Emil Sauer (<title>Piano Sonata, Op. 109</title>)
          and Alfred Reisenauer (<title>"Emperor" Piano Concerto</title>), are the marginalia "(K.
          d. Vortrags)" and "(K. d. Vtg.)," clearly written at the time, not later (OJ 1/5, p. 19).
          Again, in the diary for January 12, 1908, "K. d. Vtgs." appears in the left margin of an
          entry recording the performance of the Brahms D major Serenade, Op. 11 by the Philharmonic
          Orchestra.</p>

        <p>Despite Schenker's having held out hopes of publication even as late as 1930 (Schenker's
          diary for December 4 and 6, 1930: "Dictation of <title level="m">Performance</title>,"
            "<title level="m">Performance</title> put in order, and provided with a kind of index"),
          the work remained unfinished and unpublished in Schenker's lifetime and survives as OJ
          18/10, 19/6, 21/7–21, and 33/4, and in a compilation by Oswald Jonas as OJ 57/2–5,
          comprising twelve chapters, taken down from dictation by Jeannette Kornfeld (later
          Schenker). </p>

        <p>The work has been released in an edition that draws on later sources and omits some of
          the 1911 material, as <bibl><title level="m">The Art of Performance</title>, ed.
              <editor>Herribert Esser</editor>, Eng. transl. Irene Schreier Scott (New York: Oxford
            University Press, 2000)</bibl>. See the review of this edition by <bibl><author>David
