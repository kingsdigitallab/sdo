        <p>The eighth and ninth issues, combined as a double issue, of Schenker's periodical <ref cRef="entity-001739">
            <title level="j">Der Tonwille</title>
          </ref> (1921–24).</p>
        <div>
          <head>Contents</head>
          <p>Brahms's Handel Variations and Fugue was one of Schenker's "core" teaching pieces – the
            title is to be found in all his surviving lessonbooks, from 1912 to 1931, students
            studying it variation by variation. The bulk of this 56-page double issue is occupied by
            an analysis of the work (which became a teaching tool in itself as soon as proofs of the
            article reached Schenker). The first two-and-a-half pages of the Urlinie sheet lay out
            each variation over a single staffline so that the individual measures align down the
            page from variation to variation, facilitating close comparison; the fugue occupies the
            last page and a half.</p>

          <p>As with the essay on Beethoven’s Sonata Op. 57 in <title level="j">Tonwille</title> 7,
            there are extensive, detailed remarks on performance in the Brahms essay, including a
            paragraph on each of the variations and nearly two pages on the fugue; these include
            suggestions for fingering, and for the positioning of the hands in relation to the
            keyboard.</p>

          <p>Two short theoretical articles follow. The first contrasts the effect upon the listener
            of the work of genius (genuine) and non-genius (sham). The second relates closely to the
            first, and is of historical importance in crystallizing all Schenker's ideas so far.
            "Elucidations," which Schenker reprinted in <title level="j">Tonwille</title> 10, and
            again with minor orthographical changes in <title level="j">Meisterwerk</title> I (1925)
            and II (1926), sets out concisely with examples the notions of chord of nature, tonal
            space, passing-tone progression, dissonance and consonance, diatony, harmonic
            scale-degree, Urlinie, neighbor-note motion, tension-span, background and foreground,
            synthesis, and the way in which geniuses achieve ultimate economy of means by employing
            these principles whereas non-geniuses deal only in surface effects.</p>

          <p>The "Miscellanea" of this issue are partly linked to the Brahms analysis through the
            concept of perfection (<hi rend="italic">Vollendung</hi>) and are partly a celebration
            of the centenary of the first performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and the
            reconstruction of that first concert by the Viennese Concert Society on May 7, 1924.</p>
