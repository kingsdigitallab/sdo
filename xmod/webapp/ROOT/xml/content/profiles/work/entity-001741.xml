      <head><title>Der Tonwille</title>, Heft 2 (1922)</head>
      <div>
        <p>The second issue of Schenker's periodical <ref cRef="entity-001739">
            <title level="j">Der Tonwille</title>
          </ref> (1921–24).</p>
        <div>
          <head>Contents</head>
          <p>Issue 2, 48 pages in length (thus contractually 16 pages oversize) comprises three
            short articles on theoretical matters followed by two extended articles on single
            complete works. Notable is the absence of any "Miscellanea." </p>

          <p>The article on Beethoven Op. 2 No. 1 follows the now established template: analysis of
            each of the movements (in this case in direct succession) – source study – performance –
            survey of secondary literature. The analysis of each movement is interspersed with
            diagrams and musical examples (what Schenker called "Klischées"), as is the secondary
            literature survey, and the whole is summarized by the fold-out Urlinie-Tafel at the back
            of the issue. In the Mozart article, source study and performance are replaced by an
            essay on synthesis and genius. </p>

          <p>The Mozart and Beethoven studies constitute the first two thirds of a trilogy (though
            Schenker does not characterize them as such) representing the masters of the Viennese
            classical period, the study of Haydn's E-flat major Sonata in issue 3 being the final
            third.</p>

          <head>Publication History</head>
          <p>It was with issue 2 that Schenker's sharpest period of dissension with <ref cRef="entity-000356">Emil Hertzka</ref>, <ref cRef="entity-002408">Universal
              Edition</ref>'s director, began. On April 9, 1921, Hertzka had summoned Schenker to
            his office to express embarrassment at what Schenker had written about his friend <ref cRef="entity-000057">Paul Bekker</ref> in the <title level="m">Erläuterungsausgabe</title> for Op. 101, which was then at proof stage. The material
            was promptly withdrawn, but Schenker submitted a new version for <title level="j">Tonwille</title> issue 2 under the title <title level="a">Music Criticism</title>
            (also called "Bekker contra Schenker" – OC 52/563). On May 2, 1922, Hertzka wrote
            expressing his concern about issue 2 (OC 52/564-565): firstly it was over-length,
            secondly the <title level="a">Miscellanea</title> was almost entirely extraneous to
            music, engaging in polemics that Hertzka found uncongenial; and on the following day,
            regarding the Bekker material, he wrote "I admit to finding Paul Bekker's malicious
            jostlings quite shameless, but I can well understand it as only human that someone whose
            ears you have already boxed many times will want to avenge himself" (OC 52/566). At the
            time, there was also a shortage of the small type at the printers. Ultimately, the
            entire <title level="a">Miscellanea</title> was held over to issue 3, and at Hertzka's
            insistence the Bekker material and some anti-French polemics were removed. </p>

          <p>Schenker began work on Beethoven Op. 2 No. 1 in March 1921, drafting the Urlinien for
            all four movements March 4–10, then the analyses of the separate movements around July
            19–31, fair copies being made August 1–5 (while on vacation in the <ref cRef="entity-002334">Tyrol</ref>), with further revisions around September 14–19 and October 12. The
            "Performance" section was completed on October 16, and Schenker was correcting
            galley-proofs by October 21. The "Secondary Literature" section was drafted around
            October 17–25 and delivered to UE on October 30. Proofs of the engraved music examples
            were corrected on December 17. </p>

          <p>The Urlinien for the Mozart sonata were in preparation March 13–April 3, 1921, the
            passages from Jahn, Wyzewa and Saint-Foix were researched in the <ref cRef="entity-002430">Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde</ref> Archive on April 6,
            and the first movement was delivered to UE on July 24. The "Secondary Literature"
            section was finished on November 18. Work continued on December 6 and was evidently
            finished on December 13. On December 15, Schenker successfully argued with UE that the
            Mozart must precede the Beethoven. He was correcting galley-proofs on January 14–16,
            1922. The issue was released on July 10, 1922 (OC/569). </p>

          <p>It is not implausbile that the double-sided Urlinie sheet for Beethoven Op. 2, No. 1
            was the spark for the idea that was mooted by Hertzka in early 1922: an Urlinie edition
              (<hi rend="italic">Urlinie-Ausgabe</hi>) of the Beethoven piano sonatas, each
            containing an edition of the sonata plus an Urlinie sheet. (For more on this, see <ref cRef="entity-000055">Beethoven</ref>.)</p>
