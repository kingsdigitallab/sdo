            <hi rend="bold">Note to user:</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Schenker Documents Online</hi>
            project is in a transitional phase. This site currently contains only the 600-plus
            "profiles" of <hi rend="italic">SDO</hi> together with seventeen informational pages.
            The principal content (items of correspondence, diary entries, lessonbook entries, and
            other material) is in process of being moved over from the pilot project site to this
            location, a process that will take about a year to complete. For this material, please

            <hi rend="italic">Schenker Documents Online</hi> is a digital edition of three large
            collections of documents — the voluminous <hi rend="bolditalic">correspondence</hi>
            between Heinrich Schenker and the members of his circle, together with the theorist’s
              <hi rend="bolditalic">diaries</hi> and <hi rend="bolditalic">lessonbooks</hi>; these
            are supported by additional documents relating to his life, and a set of "<hi
              rend="bold">profiles</hi>" of people, places, and organizations with which he came
            into contact, the newspapers and journals that he read, and his own works. </p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">SDO</hi> does not provide facsimiles; it is thus in no sense a
            digitization project, nor is it an archive in the strict sense. Rather, it is a
            scholarly edition, which aims to present near-diplomatic transcriptions of original
            texts, together with English translations, summaries, supporting commentary, and such
            interpretation as is necessary to relate these documents to Schenker’s personal
            development and those of his correspondents. </p>
          <p>Because it is digital, it provides direct hyperlinks between documents, facilitating
            rapid movement from document to document; and it offers the end-user a range of tools
            with which to search and browse documents, thus facilitating the task of understanding
            and contextualization. </p>

          <head>Heinrich Schenker</head>
          <p>Viennese musician and teacher Heinrich Schenker (1868–1935) was the twentieth century's
            leading theorist of tonal music, producing a series of innovative studies and editions
            between 1903 and 1935, while exerting a powerful and sustained influence, directly and
            through his pupils, on the teaching of music from the 1930s onward in the USA, and since
            the 1970s in Europe and elsewhere. Today, Schenkerian theory and analysis constitutes a
            large and ever-growing field of vital academic study, with its own body of scholars,
            journals, book literature, institutions, and courses of instruction. </p>

          <p>In addition to his published work, Schenker left behind approximately 130,000
            manuscript and typescript leaves comprising unpublished works, preparatory materials,
            and personal documents, preserved in two dedicated archives, numerous libraries, and
            private possession. (For more information on these collections, see <ref
              cRef="major_collections">"Major Collections."</ref>) Of the personal documents,
            Schenker maintained a vigorous correspondence over nearly half a century, kept a
            meticulously detailed diary over 40 years, and recorded precise notes on the lessons
            that he gave over 20 years. It is these three collections of personal documents that
            constitute the core of <hi rend="italic">SDO</hi>. (For a more detailed study of
            Schenker's life and work, see <ref cRef="heinrich_schenker">"Heinrich
          Schenker."</ref>)</p>
