        <p><hi rend="bold">Waldheim-Eberle</hi>,  Viennese firm of printers, lithographers, and music engravers.  The printing firm of R. v. Waldheim, involved in newspaper printing, was founded in 1892, and within a few years went into partnership with the lithography and music-engraving firm of Josef Eberle &amp; Co.  By 1918, the joint firm of R.v. Waldheim, Josef Eberle &amp; Co., also known as Waldheim-Eberle, located at Vienna VII, Seidengasse 3-11, encompassed book printing, lithography, music engraving, music printing, book binding, and other types of printing.  The Josef Eberle published works with its own imprint, including early works by Franz Schreker, e.g. the symphonic overture <hi rend="italic">Ekkehard</hi>, Op. 12, and choral-orchestral work <hi rend="italic">Schwanengesang</hi>, Op. 11 (1903).  At the beginning of the Nazi era in Austria, the firm was taken over by the arianized firm of M. M&#xFC;ller &amp; Sohn.</p>
        <p>Schenker's <ref cRef="instrumentations-tab"><hi rend="italic">Instrumentations-Tabelle</hi></ref> (pseudonymously published under the name Artur Niloff) was initially to have been <hi rend="italic">published</hi> by Waldheim-Eberle, but negotiations in 1905 with its Director, Josef Stritzko, failed.   Universal Edition, which used Waldheim-Eberle for much of its engraving and printing (notable cases being Mahler's <hi rend="italic">Das Lied von der Erde</hi>, Schoenberg's <hi rend="italic">Pierrot lunaire</hi>, and Jan&#xE1;&#x10D;ek's <hi rend="italic">K&#xE1;t'a Kabanov&#xE1;</hi>), took the work over and published it in 1909, the engraver being Waldheim-Eberle.  Already in 1902/03, and in its second edition in 1908, Schenker's <hi rend="italic">Beitrag zur Ornamentik</hi> was produced for UE by Waldheim-Eberle, as was his edition of J. S. Bach's <hi rend="italic">Chromatic Fantasy &amp; Fugue</hi> (1910).  Others of Schenker's UE publications may also have been engraved and/or printed by the firm.</p>
