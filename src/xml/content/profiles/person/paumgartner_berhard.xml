          <head>Paumgartner and Schenker</head>
        
        <p>In 1914, Viktor Zuckerkandl introduced Paumgartner to Schenker, and in September 1914
          Paumgartner reviewed Schenker's monograph <title level="m">Beethovens Neunte
          Sinfonie</title> in <title level="j">Heimgarten</title>, a clipping of which is preserved in
          Schenker's scrapbook (OC 2/p. 45). Schenker reported the review enthusiastically to Emil
          Hertzka (UE), saying that he would like "to pay him this courtesy" (WSLB 227, September
          24, 1914).</p>
          
        <p>Schenker reports in his diary that in spring 1919 he planned to spend the summer vacation
          in the Salzburg region. After he experienced difficulty in obtaining authorization to
          travel, he wrote to Pamgartner as Director of the Mozarteum at the beginning of June,
          asking him to intervene on his behalf with the Salzburg regional government.</p>

        <p>Only one letter, from Paumgartner to Schenker, is known to survive as OJ 13/15 (1915). A
          file of "typed excerpts from Schenker's Tageb&#xFC;cher and from letters and reviews
          by Paumgartner," survives as OJ 59/13.</p>
