        <p>Leading German conductor of the 20th century.</p>

        <head>Furtw&#xE4;ngler and Schenker</head>
        <p>Son of a well-known archaeologist, Wilhelm Furtw&#xE4;ngler studied with Rheinberger and
          von Schillings. In 1913, while working as Kapellmeister in L&#xFC;beck, he first read
          Schenker's monograph <title level="m">Beethovens neunte Sinfonie</title> (1912).
          Remembering his initial reactions, he stressed Schenker's renunciation of hermeneutics and
          historicism as having been revelatory for him, although he admitted that he was appalled
          by his polemics, which "in many cases went too far" (<title level="a">Heinrich Schenker:
            Ein zeitgem&#xE4;&#xDF;es Problem,</title> in <title level="m">Ton und Wort</title>).
          However, it was not until May 1919 (the year in which he became conductor of the Viennese
          Tonk&#xFC;nstler-Orchester, after which he worked for the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde)
          that he met Schenker, the latter's account in his diary being rather positive as
          Furtw&#xE4;ngler had shown himself "willing to serve a timely mission" (diary, OJ 2/14,
          pp. 2065-2067, May 4, 1919; also Sbb 55 Nachl 13, [1], November 5, 1919). Schenker gave
          Furtw&#xE4;ngler advice about analytical details, and the latter readily accepted and
          sought this advice, though he never became Schenker's pupil.</p>
        <p>Their relationship soon transcended mere analytical instruction. Furtw&#xE4;ngler and
          Schenker ultimately discussed all kinds of professional matters, sometimes even social,
          political, and religious questions. As he became increasingly influential in German
          musical life (as Generalmusikdirektor in Berlin, 1928, chief conductor at Bayreuth in
          1931), Furtw&#xE4;ngler repeatedly pleaded on behalf of Schenker's pupils (especially Hans
          Weisse and Oswald Jonas) and for publication of Schenker's writings, notably for the
          "Eroica" Symphony analysis for which he in fact paid 3,000 Marks in 1931 (diary, OJ 4/4,
          pp. 3623-3627, June 1, 6, 9, 12, 1931). In January-February 1933, he was in communication
          with Ludwig Karpath about the possibility of an appointment for Schenker at the Vienna
          Akademie f&#xFC;r Musik und darstellende Kunst (=Conservatory), and around the same time
          he strove to bring Schenker to Berlin to teach a masterclass in composition due to fall
          vacant in September 1933 (OC 18/37-38, December 10, 1932; diary OJ 4/6, p. 3817, March 2,
          1933), but this came to nothing with Hitler's installation as Reichskanzler on January 30,
          1933.</p>
        <p>However, Schenker became more critical of Furtw&#xE4;ngler in the mid-1920s. Obviously
          deeming his successes to be too easily achieved, he accused him of superficial musical
          understanding, personal vanity, and greed for money (see eg diary, OJ 3/6, pp. 2578-2579,
          October 4, 1923). But aside from all the severe criticism, Schenker was aware of
          Furtw&#xE4;ngler's outstanding talent, this double-edged assessment culminating in a
          remark uttered in his diary that it was "desolating to have to say that [Furtw&#xE4;ngler]
          is and will be the premier conductor of our time!" (OJ 3/7, pp. 2808-2809, April 11,
          1925). Although Furtw&#xE4;ngler quit his post in Vienna in 1924, the two men stayed in
          regular contact, writing letters, and meeting whenever Furtw&#xE4;ngler came to Austria.</p>
        <p>Their difficult acquaintance became ever more complicated in the early 1930s. Having read
          some articles by Furtw&#xE4;ngler in the <ref cRef="neue_freie_presse"><title level="j"
              >Neue Freie Presse</title></ref> (see Furtw&#xE4;ngler's articles "Verkannte
          Wagner"and "Lebenskraft" [insert links]), Schenker sketched an extensive, enthusiastic
          letter to the conductor in November 1931, writing about the fundamentals of musical
          aesthetics, the decline of modern music, and ways to rescue musical culture (in which
          Furtw&#xE4;ngler was to be involved by establishing a Vienna festival similar to that of
          Bayreuth or Salzburg), drawing analogies from the worlds of finance, film, and religion,
          and signaling his overall, far-reaching approval of Furtw&#xE4;ngler's ideas (OJ 5/11,
          [1], vsn 1: November 13, 1931; ibid., vsn 2: November 13, 1931). Written in the year of
          Furtw&#xE4;ngler's financial support for <title level="j">Das Meisterwerk in der
          Musik</title>, vol. III, this letter marks the apogee of Schenker's esteem for
          Furtw&#xE4;ngler and a period of intensive communication.</p>
        <p>Their relationship was, however, soon to be clouded by an incident from 1933: After
          Schenker had declined to give a speech for the Brahms centenary in Vienna (OJ 11/16, [12],
          September 22, 1932), he held it against Furtw&#xE4;ngler that the latter plagiarized his
          ideas when the conductor himself delivered the address, "Johannes Brahms" [insert link]
          (see e.g. OJ 4/6, p. 3833, May 16, 1933); Schenker's pupils seem to have confirmed him in
          his grievances. A severe inner rift resulted, though there is no evidence that Schenker
          ever took Furtw&#xE4;ngler to task on this matter. On the other hand, the rise of the Nazi
          party and German anti-semitism did not have any direct effect on Furtw&#xE4;ngler's
          private appraisal of Schenker. Although he decided not to publish an article on the
          theorist's works that he had for some time been planning to write and accepted the
          position of Vice-President of the Reichsmusikkammer, Schenker praised Furtw&#xE4;ngler's
          behavior at the time of his conflict over Hindemith's music, which led to his resigning
          from all official posts.</p>
        <p>After Schenker's death, Furtw&#xE4;ngler kept in touch with Jeannette Schenker until at
          least 1937. In the later 1940s, he renewed contact with Oswald Jonas who helped him when
          Furtw&#xE4;ngler was accused of Nazi allegiances. He finally published the long-awaited
          article on Schenker's theories in 1947, concentrating on the concept of <hi rend="italic"
            >Fernh&#xF6;ren</hi> (distance-hearing) that doubtless influenced his way of perceiving
          and shaping music, but the text passed unnoticed in German music theory.</p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="bold">Correspondence with Schenker</hi>
        </p>
        <p>Extensive correspondence between Furtw&#xE4;ngler and Heinrich Schenker extends from 1919
          to 1933, and survives as OJ 5/11, OJ 11/16, Sbb 55, Nachl 13, and OC 18/26, 37-38, 49-50,
          55, 59, OC 54/296, 299-301, that with Ludwig Karpath regarding Schenker as OC 18/27-28,
          46-47, 52 and OJ 35/4 and 71/11. Furtw&#xE4;ngler corresponded with Moriz Violin (OJ
          70/17, also 70/68), Oswald Jonas (OJ 36/19, also 69/11), and with Hans Weisse, whose
          progress in the US he watched closely.</p>
