        <p><hi rend="bold">Carl Heinrich Carsten Reinecke (born Altona, June 23, 1824;  died Leipzig, March 10, 1910),</hi> German concert pianist, teacher, editor, and writer on music.</p>
        <p>From 1860, Reinecke was professor of piano at the Leipzig Conservatory, of which he became the Director in 1897.  Reinecke was a prolific composer, edited keyboard concertos, and was author of several books and many articles.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Schenker disagreed with Reinecke's readings in editions, generally citing his name along with others, as in the following statement:  "It is imperative for me by these means at long last to eradicate existing preconceptions that have unfortunately been propagated even by such musicians as, e.g., B&#xFC;low, Reinecke, Busoni, etc." (letter to Emil Hertzka, WSLB 69/71, November 1, 1910).  Schenker criticizes Reinecke's <hi rend="italic">Die Beethoven'sche Clavier-Sonaten</hi> (Leipzig, 1873, 9/1924--of which there was a copy in Schenker's personal library) in his essay on Beethoven Op. 2, No. 1 (<hi rend="italic">Der Tonwille</hi>, Heft 2 (1922), p. 48; Eng. trans., vol. I, pp. 94-95).</p>
