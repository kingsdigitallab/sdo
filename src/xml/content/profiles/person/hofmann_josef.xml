        <p><hi rend="bold">Josef Hofmann [J&#xF3;zef Kazimierz] (born Krak&#xF3;w, Jan 20, 1876;  died Los Angeles, Feb 16, 1957),</hi> Polish pianist, one of the greatest and internationally most acclaimed of his day.</p>
        <p>Hofmann studied with Anton Rubinstein in Germany;  on the staff at the Vienna Conservatory from 1901-29, but from 1924 head of the piano division at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia and director of the Institute from 1926 (when he became an American citizen) to 1938.  He retired in 1940.</p>
        <p>He was the earliest professional musician to make a recording--on wax cylinder in 1887--and made a number of commercial recordings.  He wrote two books on piano playing and left many compositions, under the pseudonym Michael Dvorsky.</p>

        </p>
        <p>No correspondence is known to survive between Schenker and Hofmann.  Schenker evidently had mixed feelings about his playing.  In 1906, he commented in his diary:</p>
        <p><!-- bq. --> Tuesday November 13, [1906] [...] Evening: concert [by] Josef Hofmann.  Technique of the artist:  so to speak, a self-contained physical as well as manual[?] unity, hence [makes a] most satisfactory impression.  The real nerve-center of the composition is however only very seldom captured.  [There is] even something shallow about the sonority (deriving from the shallow style of playing), and hence only little [that is] liberating about even the technique itself.  (Gummy[?])   Beethoven, C-minor Sonata, Op. 111 often childishly distorted (variations), and at its best totally misunderstood. Mumbling like an old man who has reverted to childhood. However, in the Liszt, at last the most unfettered, freeest playing. (OJ 1/5, p. 26).</p>
        <p>In 1932, Hofmann evidently expressed skepticism about a planned English translation by Arthur Waldeck of Schenker's <hi rend="italic">Harmonielehre</hi> (OJ 5/44, [3], December 31, 1932).</p>
