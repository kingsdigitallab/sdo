        <p><hi rend="bold">Rudorff, Ernst (born Berlin, Jan 18, 1840;  died Berlin, Dec 31, 1916),</hi> German pianist, teacher and composer, member of the Brahms circle.</p>
        <p>Rudorff was professor at the Berlin Hochschule f&#xFC;r Musik 1867-1910.  He was involved in the collected edition of Mozart's and Chopin's works, and a member of the editorial committee of the Denkm&#xE4;ler Deutscher Tonkunst.</p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="bold">Rudorff and Schenker</hi>
        </p>
        <p>Schenker sent him copies of his <hi rend="italic">Harmonielehre</hi>, J. S. Bach, <hi rend="italic">Chromatic Fantasy &amp; Fugue</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Kontrapunkt1</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Beethovens Neunte Sinfonie</hi>, and the two men corresponded vigorously between January 1908 and August 1912.  In thanking Schenker for the first of these works, Rudorff remarks: "When I put together what you have told me of your plans as a whole with what I have now read in your <hi rend="italic">Harmonielehre</hi>, I believe and hope that you are the long-awaited one destined to hurl the burning torch into the Tower of Babel [i.e. Wagner's world]." (OJ 3/37, 3). The two men disagreed strongly on the merits of Gluck, whom Rudorff rated highly, but agreed in their critiques of Wagner and Bruckner; they were in agreement that a "disintegration" was taking place "socially and morally," and that an artistic regeneration was unlikely to occur (Federhofer, pp.205-06).</p>

        <p>Correspondence between Schenker and Rudorff survives as OJ 5/35 (1908-09: Schenker to Rudorff : 7 items), OJ 13/37 (1908-10: Rudorff to Schenker : 13 items), and OJ 59/15 (inventory in Oswald Jonas's hand). and from Elisabeth Rudorff to Schenker as OJ 13/36 (1909-17: 3 items).</p>
