        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>The son of Viennese-Jewish intellectuals – his father, Otto, being a medical doctor and Professor
          at the University of Vienna – Zuckerkandl studied piano with <ref cRef="robert_richard"
            >Richard Robert</ref>, and embarked on the study of musicology and art history at the
          University of Vienna in 1914. Those studies were interrupted by war service in Italy
          1915–18, after which he married Marianne Bachrach in 1918. From then until 1927, he was
          active as a conductor in the opera house and concert hall in Barmen, Elberfeld, and
          Vienna, and directed the Philharmonic Chorus in Vienna 1926–29. In 1927 he took his PhD
          with a dissertation <title level="m">Prinzipien und Methoden der Instrumentation in
            Mozarts Werken</title> [Principles and Methods of Instrumentation in Mozart Works] under
            <ref cRef="adler_guido">Guido Adler</ref>. From 1927 to 1933, he worked as music,
          literature, and art critic in Berlin for the <title level="j">Ullstein Blätter</title>,
          and thereafter taught briefly at the Vienna Akademie für Musik und darstellende Kunst. He
          was acquainted with, among others, the conductors Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, and
          Wilhelm Furtwängler.</p>
        <p>In 1938 he left Austria for Stockholm, and in late 1939 emigrated to the USA, where he
          taught mathematics, philosophy, and music theory variously at Wellesley College, near
          Boston (–1942), the New School of Social Research in New York (1946–48), and St. John's
          College, Annapolis, Maryland (1948–64), receiving six years of scholarships from the
          Bollingen Foundation for research into "the nature, structure, and significance of the
          tonal language [of] the great composers," which resulted in two of his book publications.
          In 1960–64, he gave lectures at the Casa Eranos, in Ascona, Switzerland, where he settled
          in 1964. After the death of his first wife, he married Gertrude (Gerty) Bamberger (1904–65: former
          pupil of Felix Salzer at the <ref cRef="neues_wiener_konserv">Neues Wiener
          Konservatorium</ref>, sister of the Schenker pupil <ref cRef="bamberger_carl">Carl
            Bamberger</ref>, and who had taught ear-training at the <ref cRef="mannes_music_school"
            >David Mannes Music School</ref> in New York) in the 1964, following a thirty-year
          acquaintance. </p>
        <p>In the open letter for Gustav Mahler a digest of which was published in the <title
            level="j">Neue Freie Presse</title> for May 25, 1907, seeking to persuade Mahler not to
          resign his position at the Vienna Court Opera House, among the 69 signatories (which
          included Schenker, Moriz Violin, and Schoenberg and many other distinguished names in
          music, literature, the theater, and visual arts) appear the names of his famous anatomist
          uncle and journalist aunt "Hofrat Professor Dr. Emil Zuckerkandl [and] Bertha
          Zuckerkandl."</p>

        <head>Zuckerkandl and Schenker</head>
        <p>The earliest mention of Zuckerkandl in Schenker's diaries appears to be September 24,
          1914 (OC 1/16, p. 720: "Introduction of the young Zuckerkandl"). He appears as a pupil in
          Schenker's lessonbooks on October 8 and November 2, 1914; however, he was evidently
          scheduled for regular lessons, as the diary indicates: "Zuckerkandl cancels on account of
          illness" (Oct 22) – "postcard to Zuckerkandl inquiring after his health" (Oct 26) –
          "Telephoned Prof. Zuckerkandl, who reassured me; so his thoughtlessness in not replying
          was merely the nonchalance of a rich man" (Oct 28); he attended Nov 30, then was "still
          absent" on Dec 28. There is no mention of him in the lessonbooks for the years following
          1914/15 until an isolated entry on May 6, 1931; however, since the lessonbooks for the
          period 1914–22 are only sparsely recorded, it is possible that Zuckerkandl took lessons
          for a whole year or even longer. </p>

        <p>In the acknowledgements to his first book, <title level="m">Musikalische
          Gestaltung</title> (1932), Zuckerkandl states: "For the musical conception that ultimately
          lies at the heart [of this book] I have the teaching of the great theorist Heinrich
          Schenker to thank" (p. VII). In his <title level="m">Sound and Symbol</title>, vol. 1
          (1956), he declares: "While Hanslick connected the concept of motion with a shallow and
          rigid concept of form, we find a far more fruitful linking of the two ideas, form and
          motion, in the work of the greatest musical theorist of our time, Heinrich Schenker, who
          understood the musical work of art as a complex kinetic organism." (p. 78). Later in the
          same book, he speaks of repetitions that "are hidden in the inmost depths of the very
          tones, whose presence was first pointed out by Heinrich Schenker, and in which the
          miracles of the organic formation of great masterpieces are revealed." (pp. 212–13). </p>

        <p>Under the pseudonym Viktor Zauner, Zuckerkandl wrote the article <title level="a">Wort
            und Ton bei Mozart</title> in <title level="j">Der Dreiklang</title> ii (May 1937),
          41–52. </p>

        <head>Correspondence with Schenker</head>
        <p>Of the correspondence from Zuckerkandl to Schenker, three letters survive as OJ 15/34
          (undated, probably 1912/13; undated, probably 1914/15; January 14, 1918). At least two
          non-extant postcards from Schenker to Zuckerkandl are recorded in Schenker's diary, the
          tone of one of which ("some jokes about Adler’s latest presumption: a 'double-eagle
          joke'", December 10, 1916) suggests cordiality between the two men. Their communication
          while Zuckerkandl was fighting on the Italian front, especially OJ 15/34, [3] and diary
          entries, are of great interest. </p>
