        <p><hi rend="bold">Woodrow Wilson (born Staunton, VA, Dec 28, 1856;  died Washington, DC, Feb 3, 1924)),</hi> idealist President of the United States 1913-21, who brought America into the war against the Central Powers in 1917, issuing his "Fourteen Points" on January 8, 1918 to give assurances to the world regarding the aims of the war, and which formed the basis of the German surrender.  Wilson played a major role in the Versailles Treaty as a member of the "Council of Four" (with George Cl&#xE9;menceau, David Lloyd George, and Emanuele Orlando), and was the primary instigator in 1919 of the League of Nations.</p>

        <p>Schenker, in his lead article to <hi rend="italic">Der Tonwille</hi>, Heft 1, "The Mission of German Genius" (Von der Sendung des deutschen Genies), spoke of "that living incarnation of mendacity Woodrow Wilson," declaring "he must surely be named for all time as third alongside Ephialtes and Judas" (p. 6/7), and characterizing the Versailles and St. Germain Treaties as "synonymous with ultimate moral depravity, filthy mendaciousness, unparalleled incompetence, crassest ignorance, betrayal of human rights, trickery by blackmail, and theft of private property, not to mention loutish personal behavior" (pp. 6-7/7).   He asked rhetorically: "Is a manicured Wilson any bit worthier that an unmanicured German man  of honor?" (p. 11/11).   The "Fourteen Points," he says,  are "designed solely to sway opinion in the army and in the Russian and German hinterland, and in no sense for the greater good of man kind" (p.15/15), denouncing them as " full of imperialist ideas in the guise of democracy-speak" (OJ 2/10, p. 827, January 10, 1918).</p>
