        <p><hi rend="bold">Donald Francis Tovey (born Eton, July 17, 1875;  died Edinburgh, July 10, 1940),</hi> English pianist, conductor, and writer on music.</p>
        <p>Having trained first as a pianist with Sophie Weisse and studied Classics at Oxford University, Tovey embarked on a career as concert pianist in 1894, establishing an association with Joseph Joachim and the Joachim Quartet that lasted for many years, and later working with others such as Pablo Casals and Julius R&#xF6;ntgen.</p>
        <p>In 1914, he was appointed Reid Professor of Music at Edinburgh University, where, in addition to teaching, he founded and conducted the Reid Orchestra.  His program notes for the concerts of that orchestra were later republished as his <hi rend="italic">Essays in Musical Analysis</hi>.  He published editions with commentary of Bach's <hi rend="italic">Well-tempered Clavier</hi> (1924) and the Beethoven piano sonatas (1931).</p>
        <p>There is no correspondence between Schenker and Tovey, and Schenker seems to have been relatively unaware of his work.</p>
