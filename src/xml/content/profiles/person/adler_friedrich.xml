        <p><hi rend="bold">Friedrich Adler (born Vienna, July 9, 1879; died Zurich,  January 2, 1960),</hi> Austrian politician, member of the Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAP), of which his father <ref cRef="adler_victor">Victor Adler</ref> was the founder.  In 1916, as party secretary, he shot dead the Austrian Minister-President <ref cRef="sturgkh_karl">Karl St&#xFC;rgkh</ref>, was condemned to death but was pardoned by Emperor Karl I in 1918, and became a popular hero among socialists and communists.  From 1923 to 1940, he was General Secretary of the Socialist Worker's International.  Between 1938 and 1945, he played an important part in the alignment of the exiled organization of the Austrian Socialists (AVOES).  After 1945, he was in the political wilderness on account of his German nationalist views.</p>
