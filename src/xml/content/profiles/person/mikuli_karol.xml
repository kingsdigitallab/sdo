      <head>Karol [Carl] Mikuli</head>

      <div>
        <p>Polish pianist, for nearly thirty years a pivot of the musical life of Lemberg, where
          Schenker was at school.</p>

      <div>
        <head>Career Summary</head>

        <p>Mikuli studied piano with Chopin 1844-47 in Paris, and served as his assistant. For the
          next ten years, he concertized internationally, and in 1858 was appointed Director and a
          professor of the Conservatory of the Galician Music Society in Lemberg. After 1878, he
          founded his own music school and directed it until his death.</p>

        <p>As a one-time pupil of Chopin, Mikuli is regarded as having carried Chopin's method of
          playing and teaching to later generations. He also edited the collected edition of
          Chopin's works (Leipzig: Kistner, 1879), in which he was able to draw on Chopin's own
          annotated copies and personal remarks.</p>

        <head>Mikuli and Schenker</head>

        <p>Schenker, while attending the Gymnasium in Lemberg, took piano lessons with Mikuli, who
          was a source of inspiration to him. Others in Schenker's circle who took lessons from
          Mikuli were <ref cRef="rosenthal_moriz">Moriz Rosenthal</ref> and <ref
            cRef="lange_samuel_de_jnr">Samuel de Lange, jnr</ref>.</p>
