        <p><hi rend="bold">Karol (Carl) Mikuli (born Czernowitz, Bukovina, Oct 20, 1819;  died Lemberg, Galicia, May 21, 1897),</hi> Polish pianist, for nearly thirty years a pivot of the musical life of Lemberg, where Schenker was at school.</p>
        <p>Mikuli studied piano with Chopin 1844-47 in Paris, and served as his assistant.  For the next ten years, he concertized internationally, and in 1858 was appointed Director and a professor of the Conservatory of the Galician Music Society in Lemberg.  After 1878, he founded his own music school and directed it until his death.</p>
        <p>As a one-time pupil of Chopin, Mikuli is regarded as having carried Chopin's method of playing and teaching to later generations.  He also edited the collected edition of Chopin's works (Leipzig: Kistner, 1879), in which he was able to draw on Chopin's own annotated copies and personal remarks.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Schenker, while attending the Gymnasium in Lemberg, took piano lessons with Mikuli, who was a source of inspiration to him.  Others in Schenker's circle who took lessons from Mikuli were Moriz Rosenthal and Samuel de Lange, jnr.</p>
