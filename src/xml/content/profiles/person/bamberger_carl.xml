        <head>Career Summary</head>

        <p>Bamberger embarked on study of music and philosophy at the University of Vienna, but
          abandoned this in 1924 to take up the position of assistant conductor at the Danzig opera
          house (1924-27), from where he moved to the Darmstadt Landestheater (1927-30), thereafter
          to Russia (1931-35). In 1936, he married the violinist Lotte (Marie Charlotte)
          Hammerschlag, who studied with Felix Salzer in the newly founded Schenker-Institut at the
          Neues Wiener Konservatorium in 1935/36.</p>

        <p>Bamberger emigrated to the USA in 1937, where he became director of the orchestral and
          opera departments of the <ref cRef="mannes_music_school">David Mannes Music School</ref>, New York, from 1938 or 1939 (among
          others, Carl Schachter studied conducting with him there). His wife was professor of
          chamber music at the Mannes School, and his sister, Gerty Bamberger, who had also studied
          with Salzer at the Neues Wiener Konservatorium in 1935/36, and who was later to become the
          second wife of Viktor Zuckerkandl, taught ear-training there. Bamberger established
          himself as a conductor in the USA and Canada, and was also a notable photographer.</p>
