        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>The Waldeck family name was originally Dzyjivenetnik. Upon emigration to America,
          Arthur's parents changed it to "Waldeck," borrowing the name from the famous French Prime
          Minister, Ren&#xE9; Waldeck-Rousseau (1864-1904), who settled the Dreyfus Affair and
          legalized trade unions (1884). Arthur's son, Lewis Waldeck, later remembered his paternal
          grandmother, an amateur violinist, fondly as "an old Viennese anarchist." Taking after his
          mother in his political associations, Arthur was a "Lovestoneite" in the 1930s (after Jay
          Lovestone [1897-1990], one of the founders of the American Communist Party). It was during
          this time that he made a living as an accounting clerk for a fur importer while studying
          Schenker's works; his wife, Ellie, was a grade-school teacher. While Waldeck's family
          background had prepared him well in Schenker's culture and language, his politics were at
          the opposite end of the spectrum; fortunately, that subject never came up in their
          correspondence.</p>
        <p>Later, Waldeck was active as a voice teacher, having maintained a studio in Carnegie Hall
          in the 1940s and 50s. As a voice teacher, he was gentle and supportive, but he is also
          remembered as a "systems man" in his early years, who at times could be inflexible in his
          later teaching. Two of his articles on vocal pedagogy, "Excellent Singing" (1953) and
          "Voice and Voice Training" (1960) are also in the Mannes Collection.</p>

        <head>Waldeck and Schenker</head>
        <p>Waldeck was one of the pioneers of Schenker studies in America, who completed the first
          translation into English of Schenker's <title level="m">Harmonielehre</title>, and
          translated portions of <title level="m">Kontrapunkt</title> and <title level="m">Der freie
            Satz</title>. It was his translation of <title level="m">Harmonielehre</title> that
          formed the body of Oswald Jonas's project when it was accepted for publication by the
          University of Chicago Press in May of 1952. (The translation by Elisabeth Mann Borgese
          eventually replaced it as a result of criticism of the project by pre-publication
          reviewers.)</p>
        <p>Waldeck attended at least one seminar taught by <ref cRef="weisse_hans">Hans Weisse</ref>
          (attended also by Nathan Broder), and he also studied Schenker's work with the
            composer<ref cRef="citkowitz_israel"> Israel Citkowitz</ref>. Waldeck's personal library
          of Schenker's works, nearly complete and covered with copious marginalia in shorthand (now
          at the library at Mannes College), demonstrates prolonged and serious engagement with
          Schenker's works. Two copies of his translation of <title level="m">Harmonielehre</title>
          are also in this collection.</p>
