      <head>Hans von B&#xFC;low</head>
      <div>
        <p>One of the greatest German conductors and pianists of his age; editor of music.</p>

        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Hans von B&#xFC;low took piano lessons with Friedrich Wieck, and later studied in Dresden
          with Plaidy and Hauptmann. He read law at Leipzig University; having met Liszt in 1849 he
          studied piano with him, embarking on a career as a concert pianist in 1853. In 1864, he
          became conductor at the Court Opera in Munich, where he conducted Wagner music dramas for
          the first time. He became a champion of the "new school" of German composers, and also of
          Tchaikovsky. Subsequently he took up conducting positions in Hanover, Meiningen, and
          Berlin, and taught at conservatories in Frankfurt and Berlin.</p>
        <p>Von B&#xFC;low worked also as an editor of keyboard music, and it is instructive to
          itemize some of this work and the publishers concerned: of J. S. Bach, the Italian
          Concerto, the <title level="m">Chromatic Fantasy &amp; Fugue</title>, and the Fantasies in
          C minor and A minor (Berlin: Bote &amp; Bock); of C. P E. Bach, six sonatas (Leipzig:
          Peters); of Handel, selected pieces (Vienna: UE); of Haydn, the C-major Fantasy (Vienna:
          UE); of Scarlatti, eighteen pieces (Leipzig: Peters); of Beethoven, the piano sonatas Opp.
          53-111 (Stuttgart: Cotta, in the firm's <title level="s">Instruktive Ausgabe klassischer
            Klavierwerke</title>), the piano sonatas Opp. 13, 26, 27/2, 31/3 (Vienna: UE), the
          C-minor Variations and Fantasy, Op. 80, and Variations on a Russian Dance Theme (Vienna:
          UE); of Chopin, the collected Etudes, four impromptus, and the Tarantella (Vienna: UE); of
          Cramer, the Et&#xFC;des (Vienna: UE), and works by Weber, Field, and others. (Those
          published by UE were taken over from other publishers in 1904 and after.)</p>

        <head>Von B&#xFC;low and Schenker</head>
        <p>As a critic in the 1890s, Schenker praised von B&#xFC;low's work. In addition to passing
          references he offered two substantive critiques of von B&#xFC;low, in "Konzertdirigenten"
          (1894) and "B&#xFC;low-Weingartner" (1895). In the former, he wrote:
        
        <cit><q>He is for me an epochal man who frequently had the power to release the
          performing musician from the naivet&#xE9; of his instincts, who had the gift of capturing
          and communicating in clear, most purposefully chosen words the essence of music, the soul
          of music. [...] It is only a pity that this genius of a man did not communicate more of
          his ideas on works.</q></cit></p>
        
        <p>The above summary of von B&#xFC;low's editing shows how closely it intersected with
          Schenker's own editorial activities as well as the publishers with whom he worked. It
          seemed essential, perhaps, to Schenker that he prove the higher caliber of his own work.
          Hence, from early on can be found critical remarks about von B&#xFC;low as editor. In
          1901, he spoke of him as "a figure less worthy of beatification, less worthy of being
          taken seriously, than the great star-struck masses believe" (NMI C 176-01, April 13,
          1901). In 1908, he used Julius R&#xF6;ntgen, the Director of the Amsterdam Conservatory,
          as leverage in the eyes of Emil Hertzka at Universal Edition:
        
        <cit><q>Prof. R&#xF6;ntgen (Amsterdam) has asked me personally to arrange for
          him to receive [a copy of] my [C.P.E.] Bach edition--i.e. U.E. No. 548--for him. He tells
          me that he has been constantly dissatisfied with the B&#xFC;low edition (Peters), and I
          think it would be prudent, in the light of this dissatisfaction, to see whether Prof.
          R&#xF6;ntgen would replace the B&#xFC;low edition by the UE edition, at least at the
          Amsterdam Conservatory. (WSLB 20, September 28, 1908).</q></cit></p>
        
        <p>Already the <title level="m">Beitrag zur Ornamentik</title> (1903, 1908) offers extensive
          criticism of the Foreword to von B&#xFC;low's C. P. E. Bach edition for Peters, exposing
          its misunderstanding of the function of ornamentation and the nature of instrumental
          sonority by juxtaposing Bach's own words against von B&#xFC;low's (1903, pp. 4-6; Eng.
          trans., pp. 16-22, and in the individual ornament sections). Over the crux between his and
          von B&#xFC;low's edition of the <title level="m">Chromatic Fantasy &amp; Fugue</title>,
          Schenker wrote to Hertzka: "if it were a choice of playing the sonatas either according to
          von B&#xFC;low or according to me, I can assure you the musical world, those who hang
          around the Konzertgeb&#xE4;ude as well as those who tickle the ivories in their own homes,
          will turn to me alone--once, that is, they catch sight of my edition." (WSLB 116, June 2,
          1912)</p>
        <div>
          <head>Schenker's Later Criticism of von B&#xFC;low</head>
          <p><title level="m">Die letzten f&#xFC;nf Sonaten von Beethoven</title> (1913-20) provided
            an obvious battleground against von B&#xFC;low, the attacks appearing in the main
            analytical sections (e.g. "But when von B&#xFC;low explains that his 'new presentation
            of the [music] text is more vivid also for determining its thematic meaning,' then this
            is as laughable as it is absurd ...," <title level="m">Op. 110</title>, p. 70), and a
            single, sustained assault in the "Preliminary Remarks" to <title level="m">Op.
            110</title> (1914, pp. 23-25, ed. Jonas, pp. 7-10). The attacks are kept up in <title
              level="j">Der Tonwille</title>, as in <title level="a">Die Kunst zu h&#xF6;ren</title>
            (The Art of Listening), where Schenker quotes von B&#xFC;low's edition of a Scarlatti
            sonata then belittles the latter's aural ability ("B&#xFC;low has no ear for the
            multifarious processes of elaboration in cases where voices move below the root of the
            chord," <title level="j">Tonwille 3</title>, p. 24; Eng. trans., vol. I, pp. 119-20),
            and also in <title level="j">Das Meisterwerk in der Musik</title> (vol. I, pp. 143-44;
            Eng. trans., vol. I, pp. 79-80). Schenker liked to report Brahms's remark, made in the
            context of a plan for a von B&#xFC;low national monument, that B&#xFC;low was "only a
            Kapellmeister."</p>
