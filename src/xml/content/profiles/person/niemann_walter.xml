        <p><hi rend="bold">Niemann, Walter (born Hamburg, Oct 10, 1876;  died Leipzig, June 17, 1953),</hi> German composer, pianist, and writer on music</p>
        <p>Niemann graduated from the Leipzig Conservatory in 1898 with a dissertation on mensural notation. Of his many books, in 1907 he published a history of keyboard music, and later a book on virginal music (1920).  He was critic of the <hi rend="italic">Leipziger neueste Nachrichten</hi>, 1907-17, where he was outspoken and sometimes vitriolic. Max Reger (of whom Schenker was himself a harsh critic) threatened to sue him for libel.  Niemann denounced the "pathological" and "sensuous" music of Richard Strauss, Mahler and Schoenberg (again, objects of Schenker's continuous hostile criticism).</p>
        <p>In 1908, Schenker had a complimentary copy of his <hi rend="italic">Beitrag zur Ornamentik</hi>, 2nd edition, sent to him (WSLB 14).    Elsa Bienenfeld wrote a review of Niemann's biography of Brahms in the <hi rend="italic">Neues Wiener Journal</hi>, which Schenker clipped and sent to the publisher J. G. Cotta in 1920 (CA 171-172).  There is no known correspondence or contact between Muck and Schenker.</p>
