        </p>
        <p>Schenker wrote to Ludendorff on November 12, 1919 (diary OJ 3/3, p. 2400--the letter does not survive) enclosing a copy of his <hi rend="italic">Der Tonwille</hi>, Heft 1 (1921), and received a brief but sympathetic handwritten reply (OC 24/11: November 19, 1921, received November 21, and forwarded to Hertzka on 23rd). He had made an allusion to "the genius of those two time-honored generals, Hindenburg and Ludendorff" in his lead article to the journal, "The Mission of German Genius."   Schenker received a second, shorter reply (OC 24/11: January 21, 1922[?]), perhaps in response to his first letter, or perhaps to a second, saying that Ludendorf had read the pages indicated by Schenker and had been "spiritually uplifted" by them.</p>
        <p>(He also received a letter from Paul Hindenburg (OC 24/18: November 19, 1921), and the draft of Schenker's initial letter survives (OC 24/14-15, undated).)</p>
