        <p><hi rend="bold">Karl Klindworth (born Hannover, Sept 25, 1830;  died Stolpe, July 27, 1916),</hi> German pianist and conductor, pupil of Franz Liszt, whose career as a concert artist extended from 1848 to 1910.  In 1868, he was appointed a piano professor at the Moscow Conservatory;  in 1884 he moved to Berlin, where he was for a time the conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, and where he founded his own piano school, which in 1893 merged with the Scharwenka Institute to form the Konservatorium Klindworth-Scharwenka.  He was an advocate of the "modern" musical trends of his time, notably the music of Berlioz, Wagner, Liszt, Brahms, and Bruckner.  He wrote many instructional manuals for the piano.</p>
        <p>As a friend of Wagner, Klindworth created the vocal scores for the latter's music dramas from <hi rend="italic">Rienzi</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Parsifal</hi>.  He also edited or arranged the keyboard works of numerous composers, including J. S. Bach's <hi rend="italic">Well-Tempered Clavier</hi> (Mainz: Schott, 1894), the complete works of Chopin and the piano sonatas of Beethoven (both Berlin: Bote &amp; Bock, no dates), and many of these editions remain in use today.</p>
        <p>Schenker criticized Klindworth's editions for their failure to understand the composer's intentions, as for example in Chopin's in B-flat major, Op. 71, No. 2: "[Klindworth] does not grasp the genuine gist of the voice-leading [...]  What arrogance he shows toward Chopin!" (<hi rend="italic">Der Tonwille</hi>, Heft 3 (1922), p. 25; Eng. trans., vol. I, p. 120).  Of Beethoven's sonata Op. 109, for example, he included Klindworth's edition when commenting: "You will be <hi rend="italic">utterly astonished</hi> at the discrepancy between the editor and Beethoven in light of his original autograph manuscript."  (letter to Emil Hertzka, WSLB 144, January 22, 1913).</p>
