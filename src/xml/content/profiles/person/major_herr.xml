      <head>Herr Major</head>
      <div>
        <p>Close acquaintance of the Schenkers in the period around 1918-19. He fought in World War
          I, and by 1918 was a prisoner of war, released in 1919. Frequently mentioned in Schenker's
          diaries, he was evidently on intimate terms with the Schenkers. With Heinrich's brother
          Moriz, he was one of the witnesses to the marriage of Heinrich and Jeanette on November
          10, 1919.</p>
        <p>He was a member of the household of <ref cRef="bednai_frau">Jetty Bednai</ref>; yet he is
          not identified as her husband (although she was married), nor is he ever named "Herr Major
          Bednai" (Major Bednai). He was promoted to the rank of colonel (Oberst) in August 1921,
          from which time he is always referred to as "Herr Oberst" in the diaries.</p>
