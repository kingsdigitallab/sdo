        <p>The idea of a new state comprising a union of Czech and Slovak peoples, for which Masaryk had gathered support during the latter part of World War I, was endorsed by the Allies in summer 1918.  Under the Treaty of St. Germain-en-Laye of September 1918, the independence of Czechoslovakia was recognized;  on October 28, 1918, the Czech National Council in Prague proclaimed an independent republic;  in November, the Allies recognized Masaryk as head of the Provisional Czechoslovak government;  on April 18, 1920, parliamentary elections took place, and Masaryk was then elected President of the Czechoslovak Republic by the two houses of parliament.   He was re-elected in 1927 and 1934 (despite a constitutional limit of two terms), and held office until December 14, 1935.</p>
