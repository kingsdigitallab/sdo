        <p><hi rend="bold">Pairamall, Evelina (Eveline) (born Lodz, Poland, February 27, 1870)</hi>, pupil of Schenker's from at the latest January 17, 1912 (there is no mention of her in Schenker's diary before 1912) to at least 1932 and probably until Schenker's death.  According to Schenker, she was a wealthy Polish Jew and owned "twenty-seven or twenty-nine [...] properties and houses in and around <ref cRef="lodz">Lodz</ref>" (diary: OJ 1/15, p. 666, August 26, 1914).  She was also useful to Schenker on occasions in drawing his attention to items of interest and giving him useful presents.</p>
        <p>She was enrolled at the newly-founded Schenker-Insitut at the Neues Wiener Konservatorium in 1935/36, at which time she was living at Vienn III, Neulinggasse 16/6 (very close to Schenker's Reisnerstra&#xDF;e apartment).  Apparently she returned to Lodz in 1938.  Nothing more is known of her.</p>
        <p>There are two letters from Schenker to Pairamall: OJ 5/27 (November 12, 1913), OC 1B/5 (September 9, 1916, which appears to be written in shorthand).</p>
