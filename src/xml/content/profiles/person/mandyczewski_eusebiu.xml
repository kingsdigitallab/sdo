        <p><hi rend="bold">Mandyczewski, Eusebius (born Czernowitz, Bukowina, Aug 18, 1857;  died Vienna, July 13, 1929).</hi>  Romanian musicologist and archivist working in Vienna.</p>
        <p>Mandyczewski studied at Vienna University taking courses with Hanslick and Nottebohm, became a friend of Brahms, and was archivist of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde 1887-1927.  He also taught music history and organology at the Vienna Conservatory (= Akademie) 1894-1924, and was on the administration there.  He was a member of the Brahms circle.  His name is particularly associated with the Schubert collected edition, to which he contributed the ten volumes of Lieder; he was also joint editor of the Brahms collected edition, and contributed three volumes to the Haydn collected edition.</p>

          <hi rend="bold">Mandyczewski and Schenker</hi>
        </p>
        <p>As a frequent user of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde Archive, Schenker encountered Mandyczewski regularly.  In 1908, Mandyczewski requested a complimentary copy of Schenker's <hi rend="italic">Harmonielehre</hi> (OJ 1/7, p. 94).  In 1912, he proposed Schenker's name as a speaker in a forthcoming lecture series promoted by the Gesellschaft (OJ 11/22, [2]).  During his preparation of <hi rend="italic">Die letzten f&#xFC;nf Sonaten von Beethoven</hi>, Schenker sought Mandyczewski's assistance in locating autograph manuscripts and early editions of the late Beethoven sonatas, for which Schenker expressed his thanks in print, e.g. in <hi rend="italic">Op. 109</hi>:</p>
        <p><!-- bq. --> I am especially gratefully indebted to Prof. E. Mandyczewski (Vienna), who not only pointed me to the whereabouts of the autograph manuscript, but also very kindly placed the above-mentioned notes by Nottebohm at my disposal. (p. 25)</p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="bold">Correspondence</hi>
        </p>
        <p>Correspondence from Mandyczewski to Schenker survives as OJ 12/49 (1898-1928: 11 items), one letter from Otto Erich Deutsch to Mandyczewski , Schenker, and others as OC 52/486 (1922), one postcard from Mandyczewski to Moriz Violin as OJ 70/25 (1899), and he was a signatory to the letter regretting the resignation of Moriz Violin from the Vienna Akademie, OJ 70/59 (1912).</p>
