        <p><hi rend="bold">Guttmann, Sophie, [<hi rend="italic">n&#xE9;e</hi> Schifre Schenker],</hi> fourth child of Johann and Julia Schenker, younger sister of Wilhelm, older sister of Heinrich and Moriz Schenker, born (date unknown) in the family home in Galicia (presumably Wisniozczyk,now in the Ukraine).  Schifre Schenker married Salo Guttmann, a medical doctor, on January 6, 1898, and the couple had three children:  an older boy, Hans, a daughter, Frieda, and a younger son, Julian (Julko).</p>
        <p><hi rend="bold">Guttmann Family:</hi> The Guttmann family lived in Sereth (Siret), Bukovina, but on September 17, 1914, with the advance of the Russian army and destruction of their house, they fled to Vienna (OJ 1/16, pp. 711-712, containing a vivid description of the family members on its arrival).  In Vienna, they were housed briefly with Jeanette Kornfeld, then with Schenker's mother, Julia, later settling in Bielitz (Poland) during the war.  On March 22, 1919, the family attempted to return to Sereth via Vienna, but found the borders closed and were obliged to stay in Vienna for three months, Sophie and Salo staying in the accommodation of their son Hans (who was studying in Vienna), Frieda with the Marienbergs, and Hans and Julian with the Einschenks (OJ 2/12, pp. 2043-2044).  On June 23, 1919, they were in Vincovci, in Croatia, and from there they returned to Sereth where they moved into a new house and Salo found well-paid work as a doctor.In September 1939, they planned to move from Sereth to Czernowitz to be close to Frieda's family (OJ 11/31, [4]).</p>

        </p>
        <p>Schenker had Cotta send a copy of his <hi rend="italic">Harmonielehre</hi> to Sophie in 1908 (CA 80).  She is very frequently referred to in Schenker's diaries from 1918 onward as sending food supplies to Heinrich and Jeanette.  No letters from her to Heinrich Schenker are known to survive;  four items from her to Jeanette Schenker, OJ 11/31, [1]-[ 4 ], give a vivid portrayal of the family in 1938-39, and of the fears of rural Bukovina.</p>
