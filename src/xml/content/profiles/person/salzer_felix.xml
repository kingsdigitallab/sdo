        <head>Career Summary; Association with Schenker</head>
        <p>Born in Vienna into the Wittgenstein family (his mother, Helene Salzer, was the sister of
          the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein and the pianist <ref cRef="wittgenstein_paul">Paul
            Wittgenstein</ref>), Salzer began his studies with Schenker in 1931. His earlier studies
          in theory and analysis were with <ref cRef="weisse_hans">Hans Weisse</ref>, starting in
          the 1920s. After Weisse's emigration to New York in 1931, he and three other former pupils
          of Weisse (Trude Kral, Greta Kraus, and Manfred Willfort) became Schenker's students,
          forming a "seminar" that met weekly. The published result of their studies was the <title
            level="m">F&#xFC;nf Urlinie-Tafeln/Five Analyses in Sketchform</title> (New York: David
          Mannes Music School, 1932; repr. New York: Dover, 1969, as <title level="m">Five Graphic
            Music Analyses</title>). On the dissolution of the seminar in 1934 he began private
          study with Schenker.</p>
        <p>Salzer also studied musicology with <ref cRef="adler_guido">Guido Adler</ref> at Vienna
          University, writing a dissertation "Die Sonatenform bei Franz Schubert," and receiving a
          doctorate in 1926. He was a piano pupil of Malwine Br&#xE9;e (assistant to Theodor
          Leschetizky). In 1935 he received a diploma in conducting (with Oswald Kabasta) from the
          Akademie f&#xFC;r Musik und darstellende Kunst (= Vienna Conservatory).</p>
        <p>Salzer was to have been co-editor with Oswald Jonas of a monthly periodical (entitled
            <ref cRef="tonkunst_die">
            <title level="j">Die Tonkunst</title>
          </ref>) devoted to Schenker's theory. The plan for this periodical had been proposed by
          Weisse in 1927, but it never came to fruition. After Schenker's death, Salzer and Jonas,
          who were both teaching at the newly established Schenker-Institut in the <ref
            cRef="neues_wiener_konserv">Neues Wiener Konservatorium</ref>, founded the journal
            <title level="j">Der Dreiklang</title> (nine issues, 1937-38) in order to further the
          dissemination of Schenker's ideas.</p>
        <p>In 1940, shortly after settling in New York, Salzer joined the faculty of the <ref
            cRef="mannes_music_school">David Mannes Music School</ref>, taking over the position
          left vacant on Weisse's death. He served as Director from 1948 through 1955; under his
          leadership the school became a degree-granting college, and he was largely responsible for
          developing the "Techniques of Music" curriculum, based on Schenker's approach. He became
          Professor of Music at Queens College of the City University of New York in 1963; he taught
          there and later at the City University Graduate Center until the mid 1970s. He also
          continued to teach at Mannes, from 1962 to 1981.</p>
        <p>Salzer's major publications include <title level="m">Sinn und Wesen der
            abendl&#xE4;ndischen Mehrstimmigkeit</title> (Vienna: Saturn-Verlag, 1935), <title
            level="m">Structural Hearing: Tonal Coherence in Music</title> (New York: Boni, 1952;
          reprinted New York: Dover, 1962 and 1982), and <title level="m">Counterpoint in
            Composition: The Study of Voice Leading</title>, with Carl Schachter (New York:
          McGraw-Hill, 1969; reprinted New York: Columbia University Press, 1989). He contributed
          important articles to <title level="j">The Music Forum</title>, which he founded in 1967
          with co-editor William J. Mitchell.</p>

        <head>Correspondence</head>
        <p>The Schenker/Salzer correspondence survives partly among the Salzer papers now deposited
          at the New York Public Library (27 items from Schenker to Salzer, 1930-1934, FS 40/1),
          partly in the Ernst Oster Collection at the New York Public Library (3 items from Salzer
          to Schenker, 1934, OC 44/2, 36, 37), and partly in the Oswald Jonas Memorial Collection at
          University of California, Riverside, Special Collections (2 items from Salzer to Schenker,
          1932, 1934, OJ 14/1, one from Salzer to Jeanette Schenker, 1938, OJ 14/1, joint
          Salzer-Jonas correspondence with Jeanette Schenker, 1935, OJ 5/36, 12/6 [copy in 14/1],
          and correspondence between Salzer and Jonas, Oster, and Siegfried M&#xFC;ller, OJ 36/53,
          169, 188, 214, 71/31).  The legal agreement between Salzer and Jeanette Schenker over the Schenker papers, 1936, is preserved as FS, 40/2.</p>
