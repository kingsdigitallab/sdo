        <p><hi rend="bold">George A. Wedge (born Danbury, CT, Jan 15, 1890;  died Barbados, Oct 31, 1964),</hi> American organist and music teacher.</p>
        <p>Wedge studied organ, piano, and composition at the Institute of Musical Art in New York, and subsequently taught at New York University (1920-27), the Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia (1924-26), then became the Dean of the <ref cRef="institute_of_music_a">Institute of Musical Art</ref>, also that of the Juilliard School of Music (1938-46).  He wrote books on ear-training, sight-singing, keyboard harmony, and rhythm.</p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="bold">Wedge and Schenker</hi>
        </p>
        <p>As early as 1925, <ref cRef="warburg_gerald_f">Gerald F. Warburg</ref> reported that Wedge was "lecturing on the Urline at the Damrosch Conservatory [i.e. Institute of Musical Art]" (OJ 3/8, p. 2876).  In a 1932 interview, Irvin Kolodin, who studied at the Institute while Wedge was teaching there, described him as "a pioneer in [Schenker's] work in America."  <ref cRef="weisse_hans">Hans Weisse</ref> speaks of Wedge as:  "the chief director of the Institute of Musical Art, who has been teaching according to your books for a long, long time, and is dying to meet me and learn more from me." (OJ 15/16, [82], October 15, 1931).  Wedge is said to have produced a graph of the "Liebestod" from Wagner's <hi rend="italic">Tristan und Isolde</hi> (Berry).</p>
        <p>There is no known correspondence between Wedge and Schenker.</p>
