        <head>Career Summary</head>
        <p>Dahms was music critic of the <title level="j">Kleines Journal</title> (1912) and the
            <title level="j">Neue Preussische Kreuz-Zeitung</title>, and wrote for, among other
          publications, the <title level="j">Ostdeutsche Rundschau</title>, the <title level="j"
            >Allgemeine Musik-Zeitung</title>, the <title level="j">M&#xFC;nchner neueste
            Nachrichtungen</title>, and the <title level="j">Musikus-Almanach</title>, at least
          between 1913 and 1928.</p>
        <p>The books that Dahms published during Schenker's lifetime, all of which were in
          Schenker's private library at his death, are:</p>

        <p>Dahms moved to Lisbon in 1935, took on the identity Gualterio Armando, and continued to
          publish books and to compose music there (a number of his scores have recently come to
          light in Italy).</p>

        <head>Dahms and Schenker</head>
        <p>Dahms became one of Schenker's strongest supporters and advocates. He first came to
          Schenker's attention in May 1913. His review of Schenker's <title level="m">Chromatic
            Fantasy &amp; Fugue</title> edition (July 15, 1913) pleased the latter, several other
          reviews at that time drew attention to Schenker's ideas, and his review of <title
            level="m">Die letzten f&#xFC;nf Sonaten ... op. 109</title>, "Beethoven redivivus"
          [insert link], December 31, 1913, and the cordial response from Schenker that it evoked,
          encouraged him in April 1914 to express the desire (reported in WSLB 202) to move from
          Berlin to Vienna in order to become a pupil of Schenker's. He did study briefly with
          Schenker's pupil <ref cRef="vrieslander_otto">Otto Vrieslander</ref> (who was based in
          Munich) c.1919, but decided to discontinue this and sought Schenker's advice on further
          study. Schenker regularly arranged for him to receive complimentary copies of his
          publications, from <title level="m">Die letzten f&#xFC;nf Sonaten ... op. 109</title> to
            <title level="j">Das Meisterwerk in der Musik</title>, vol. III (1930). In 1918, he was
          involved with Vrieslander, Halm and <ref cRef="roth_herman">Herman Roth</ref> in an
          attempt to launch a Festschrift for Schenker's fiftieth birthday, through Universal
          Edition.</p>
        <p>Dahms was conservative in outlook, applauded Schenker's uncompromising pronouncements on
          contemporary music, and shared his German nationalist and anti-democratic political views
          (though he disagreed with him hotly over Germany's militarism).</p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="bold">Correspondence</hi>
        </p>
        <p>105 items of correspondence survive from Dahms to Schenker in OJ 10/1 (1913 to 1931), and
          one letter from UE to Dahms with annotations by Schenker (OC 52/617, undated). No
          correspondence from Schenker to Dahms is known to survive. There are also many references
          to Dahms in Schenker's diary.</p>
        <p>In addition, clippings of eight reviews by Dahms of Schenker's publications are preserved
          in Schenker's scrapbook (OC 2/pp. 38, 41-42, 49, 54, 61, 67, 72, 75). Of these, two more
          general articles about Schenker are:</p>
