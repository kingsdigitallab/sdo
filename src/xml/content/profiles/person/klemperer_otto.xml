        <p><hi rend="bold">Otto Klemperer (born Breslau, May 14, 1885;  died Zurich, July 6, 1973),</hi> German conductor and composer of Jewish descent.  Klemperer studied with Iwan Knorr at the Frankurt Conservatory, and with Pfitzner at the Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatory in Berlin.  He occupied posts in Prague (1907) on Mahler's recommendation, then Hamburg (1910-12), Barmen (1913-14), Strasburg (1914-17), Cologne (1917-24),  Wiesbaden (1924-27), then at the Berlin Staatsoper responsible for new and recent works, and performance of repertory works in a non-traditional manner at the Kroll Theater (1927-31), where he conducted works by Stravinsky, Schoenberg, Hindemith, Jan&#xE1;&#x10D;ek, Weill, and others.  Thereafter, he continued to work at the Staatsoper until he emigrated to the USA in 1933, where he conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra (1933-39) and other major orchestras.  After World War II he conducted at the Budapest Opera (1947-50), then contracted with the Philharmonia Orchestra of London from 1954, conducting also at Covent Garden in the 1960s.</p>
        <p>He established himself as an authoritative interpreter of the Austro-Hungarian repertory from Haydn to Mahler.</p>

          <hi rend="bold">Correspondence with Schenker</hi>
        </p>
        <p>Correspondence between Klemperer and Schenker exists as OC 44/29 (September 20, 1934) and OC 44/24, 27, 28 (undated), and Klemperer is known to have visited Schenker at his home on September 11, 1934 (diary).  Little is known of Schenker's attitude toward Klemperer's performance, other than a diary entry from June 7, 1933: "Klemperer conducts <hi rend="italic">Till Eulenspiegel</hi> quite excellently;  Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, on the other hand, in the conventionally ignorant rut."</p>
