        <p><hi rend="bold">Schenker [n&#xE9;e Mosler], Julia (born 18??-died Kautzen, Dec 22, 1917),</hi> mother of Heinrich Schenker.</p>
        <p>Julia's father had been a tailor, "but always devoted himself to Hebrew literature, in which he was very well-versed"; and in her "parental house there existed that spiritual atmosphere that is peculiar to the Jews" (OJ 1/16, p. 812: pp. 812-17 contain a tribute to her by Heinrich on her burial day).</p>
        <p>Julia and her husband, J<ref cRef="schenker_johann">ohannes</ref>, Heinrich's father, lived in <ref cRef="wisniowczyk">Wisniowczyk</ref>, in <ref cRef="galicia">Galicia</ref>, where they had at least six children, of whom four survived: Wilhelm, Shifre, Heinrich, and Moriz. After her husband's death in late 1887, she moved with her impoverished family to Vienna, to be near Heinrich.  Of this he later recorded:</p>
        <p><!-- bq. --> Already during my earliest years, because I had to support mother, sister [Schifre, later Sophie Guttmann], younger brother (today the so ungrateful billionaire) [Moriz], and niece [Frieda?] by giving piano lessons, I gladly accepted an offer from a Viennese friend of [Maximilian] Harden to write something for him. (DLA 69.930/10, September 25, 1922, to Halm)</p>
        <p>Heinrich took his responsibilities toward his mother seriously ("for [September] 19 (Jewish holidays) : a few pennies for Mama, seats in the synagogue etc.": OJ 6/4, [], Schenker to Violin, September 15/18, 1906), and taking care of her when she was ill.  Julia Schenker provided a vital link to Heinrich's Jewish heritage, coming out with Jewish sayings, and reminding him of customs and holy days:</p>
        <p><!-- bq. --> Evening with mother at Uncle and Aunt Einschenk's, for Passover.  Old memories!:  The ritual meal &lt;strike&gt;suddenly&lt;/strike&gt; unexpectedly remedies an upset stomach that has persisted for several days!   (OJ 1/6, p. 36: March 30, 1907)</p>
        <p>During the period after <ref cRef="schenker_jeanette">Jeanette Kornfeld</ref> left her first husband to be with Heinrich (1910-), Julia accepted and befriended Jeanette when others in Heinrich's circle ostracized her.</p>
        <p>Julia was housed with <ref cRef="schenker_wilhelm">Wilhelm Schenker</ref> and his wife Dodi in <ref cRef="kautzen">Kautzen</ref> in the final months before her death on December 22, 1917, and Heinrich was much involved in the burial ritual (in <ref cRef="waidhofen">Waidhofen an der Thaya</ref>, a town not far from Kautzen that had a Jewish cemetery), the saying of &lt;a href="../../profile/kaddish_the_jewish_m.html"&gt;Kaddisch&lt;/a&gt;, and the erection of the gravestone (diary for December 1917, January/February 1918, <hi rend="italic">passim</hi>).  In 1918, Schenker tried to have the coffin transported from Waidhofen to Vienna, but the cost proved too high.</p>
