        <head>Career Summary</head>

        <p>Weigl studied piano with Anton Door and music theory with Robert Fuchs at the Vienna
          Conservatory, later composition with Zemlinsky, and musicology with Guido Adler at Vienna
          University, receiving a PhD in 1903 on "The Life of E. A. F&#xF6;rster"). He was a solo repetiteur
          under Gustav Mahler at the Vienna Hofoper 1904-06, taught at the Neues Wiener Konservatorium from
          1918, and taught music theory at Vienna University from 1930.</p>
          
          <p>In 1938, he emigrated to New
          York, where he taught music theory and composition, becoming a U.S. citizen in 1943. His
          output as a composer was very large, and his music was praised by Richard Strauss,
          Schoenberg, Furtw&#xE4;ngler, Casals, and Bruno Walter. His wife was <ref cRef="weigl_vally">Vally (Valerie)

          <head>Weigl and Schenker</head>
        
        <p>Schenker seems to have encountered Weigl for the first time on December 12, 1913, in the
          Archive of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde (OJ 1/13, p. 486). The two men were in
          contact again in 1916, and during the summer vacations of 1922 and 1923, when Weigl
          expressed an interest in the concept of the Urlinie. Schenker was present at the
          performance of a string quartet of Weigl's by the Ros&#xE9; Quartet in 1927, and
          commented unfavorably in his diary, as he did on two other works in 1929 and 1930,
          describing his D-minor Symphony as "truly childish!"</p>

        <p>The correspondence between Karl and Vally Weigl and Schenker survives as OJ 5/44

          Washington.</p>
