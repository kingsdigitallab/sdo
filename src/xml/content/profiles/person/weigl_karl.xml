        <p><hi rend="bold">Karl Weigl (born Vienna, Feb 6, 1881;  died New York, Aug 11, 1949),</hi> Viennese composer.</p>
        <p>Weigl who studied piano (Anton Door) and music theory (Robert Fuchs) at the Vienna Conservatory, later composition (Zemlinsky) and musicology (Guido Adler at Vienna University: PhD, 1903: "The Life of E. A. F&#xF6;rster").  He was a solo repetiteur under Mahler at the Vienna Hofoper 1904-06, taught at the New Vienna Conservatory from 1918, and taught music theory at Vienna University from 1930.  In 1938, he emigrated to New York, where he taught music theory and composition, becoming a U.S. citizen in 1943.  His output as a composer was very large, and his music was praised by Richard Strauss, Schoenberg, Furtw&#xE4;ngler, Casals, and Bruno Walter.  His wife was Vally (Valerie) Weigl [<hi rend="italic">n&#xE9;e</hi> Pick].</p>

          <hi rend="bold">Weigel and Schenker</hi>
        </p>
        <p>Schenker seems to have encountered Weigl for the first time on December 12, 1913, in the Archive of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde (OJ 1/13, p. 486).  The two men were in contact again in 1916, and during the summer vacations of 1922 and 1923, when Weigl expressed an interest in the concept of the Urlinie.  Schenker was present at the performance of a string quartet of  Weigl's by the Ros&#xE9; Quartet in 1927, and commented unfavorably in his diary, as he did on two other works in 1929 and 1930, describing his D-minor Symphony as "truly childish!"</p>
