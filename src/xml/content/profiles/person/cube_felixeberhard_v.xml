        <p><hi rend="bold">Felix-Eberhard von Cube (born Hannover, Jan 27, 1903;  died Hamburg, March 12, 1988),</hi> German music theorist, teacher, and composer.  Pupil of Schenker's.</p>
        <p>Son of the architect and archaeologist Gustav von Cube, Felix-Eberhard grew up in Munich and studied music privately with <ref cRef="vrieslander_otto">Otto Vrieslander</ref>, a family friend who was for a time the private librarian to the playwright Carl Sternheim, Cube's maternal uncle. On Vrieslander's recommendation, Cube went to Vienna in late 1923 to study with Schenker.</p>
        <p>The first lesson recorded in Schenker's lessonbooks (OC 3/3) is dated January 23, 1924, the last was June 4, 1926, with one postal lesson on January 27, 1927.  Cube's instruction began with the final section of Schenker's <hi rend="italic">Kontrapunkt2</hi>, continuing with a year of thoroughbass, fugal technique, analytical studies (mostly keyboard repertory), source studies, and work on Cube's own compositions.</p>
        <p>After a period of five years' teaching at the Rheinisches Musikseminar, a provincial conservatory in Duisburg in Germany's industrial area, he was recommended by Schenker to help <ref cRef="violin_moriz">Moriz Violin</ref> set up a Schenker-Institut in Hamburg in 1931. The Institute had a shaky existence for about two years, closed down in 1934 and reopened after the War as the Heinrich-Schenker-Akademie, though with only modest success, continuing for another decade and a half.</p>
        <p>Unswervingly loyal to Schenker and his cause, Cube attempted to put his teacher's theories into a useful pedagogical form for German-speaking musicians, in a <hi rend="italic">Lehrbuch der musikalischen Kunstgesetze</hi>, a typewritten treatise first conceived around 1934 but not finished until 1953 (and periodically augmented thereafter with further graphic analyses); an English version of this appeared in 1987 as <hi rend="italic">The Book of the Musical Artwork</hi>. A second book, <hi rend="italic">Todeskampf oder Wiederauferstehung der Deutschen Musik</hi> (Mortal Struggle, or the New Resurrection of German Music), is essentially a diatribe against modernism, but includes anecdotal information about his upbringing, his studies with Schenker, and his career as a teacher in Duisburg and Hamburg. Cube also wrote a quantity of chamber music, songs, and concertos, some of which were performed by North German Radio.</p>
        <p>Cube and Schenker corresponded extensively between 1924 and 1934: OJ 9/34 (Cube to Schenker: 1925-34: 42 items) and letters in family possession: vC (Schenker to Cube: 1924-34:  51 items); correspondence between Schenker and Violin comprise OJ 70/2 (1 item) and 70/11 (1931: 3 items).</p>
