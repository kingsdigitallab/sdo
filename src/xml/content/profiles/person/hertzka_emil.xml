        <p><hi rend="bold">Emil Hertzka (born Budapest, August 3, 1869;  died Vienna, May 9, 1932)</hi>, Viennese music publisher.  As Director of <ref cRef="universal_edition">Universal Edition</ref> from 1907 to 1932, Hertzka fashioned the company into one of the leading music publishing houses of the 20th century, his fame resting primarily on his advocacy of the more progressive composers at the turn of the 20th century, and especially of the members of the Second Viennese School (Schoenberg, Berg, Webern), Weill, Bart&#xF3;k, and Jan&#xE1;&#x10D;ek.</p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="bold">Hertzka and Universal Edition</hi>
        </p>
        <p>Born in Budapest, Hertzka studied chemistry, and also music and literature, at the University of Vienna.  In 1893, he joined the music publishing firm of Weinberger (some sources say that he first joined the publisher and concert agency Gustav L&#xE9;wy, which sold out to Weinberger in 1897), the proprietor of which, Josef Weinberger, was one of the founding subscribers of Universal Edition, Vienna.  UE was formed in 1901 through the collaboration of three existing publishers, Josef Weinberger, Adolf Robitschek, and Bernhard Herzmansky (of Ludwig Doblinger), with the aim of creating Austrian editions of Classical composers, and providing educational materials for schools.  After six years, the company was on the brink of failing when, in 1907, Hertzka was brought in to rescue it.  While maintaining the two original lines, he moved contemporary music to the center of its enterprise.  By sound judgement, a keen sense of publishing politics, and skillful negotiation, he identified many of the leading progressive and avant-garde composers.  By entering into agreements with other companies (e.g. Eberle, Josef Aibl, F&#xFC;rstner, Bote &amp; Bock, Simrock) in the first few years, offering contracts to progressive composers (e.g. Mahler, Schoenberg, Schreker, Foerster), with many of whom he forged strong personal bonds, and adopting aggressive advertising strategies, Hertzka brought to UE the profile that it has had ever since as the leading publisher of contemporary music.</p>
        <p>Later, Hertzka launched in-house journals--<hi rend="italic">Musikp&#xE4;dagogische Zeitschrift</hi> (1911), <hi rend="italic">Musica divina</hi> (1913), <ref cRef="musikblatter_des_anb"><hi rend="italic">Musikbl&#xE4;tter des Anbruch</hi></ref> (1919), <hi rend="italic">Pult und Taktstock </hi>(1924), and <hi rend="italic">Schrifttanz</hi> (1927)--which offered publicity and forums for discussion of UE's catalog, and by acquiring the publishers A. J. Gutmann in 1920 and Philharmonischer Verlag in 1927 he extended UE's range significantly.  As a result of all these developments, UE became a principal publisher of the music of Reger, Richard Strauss, Mahler, Bruckner, Szymanovski, Zemlinsky, Schreker, Josef Marx, Godowsky, Delius, Milhaud, Respighi, Krenek, Weill and other late-19th and early-20th-century composers, in addition to almost all of the leading "modern" composers (with the notable exceptions of Stravinsky and Hindemith).</p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="bold">Hertzka and Schenker</hi>
        </p>
        <p>Schenker was recruited as an editor in 1901 to UE, with whom he published his edition of C. P. E. Bach keyboard pieces and <hi rend="italic">Beitrag zur Ornamentik</hi> (1903).  His first publication under Hertzka was the <ref cRef="instrumentations-tab"><hi rend="italic">Instrumentations-Tabelle</hi></ref> (pseudonymous author "Artur Niloff") (1908), followed by his edition of J. S. Bach's <hi rend="italic">Chromatic Fantasy &amp; Fugue</hi> (1910).  Herztka's arrival in 1907 rapidly created an environment wholly inimical to Schenker, and it was inevitable that the two men would come into conflict.  Schenker goaded Hertzka with such remarks as that UE was a publisher "that places its main emphasis these days on anti-musical music" (WSLB 52, February 7, 1910).  Hertzka's driven management style and use of modern publishing techniques (of which the typewriter was a symbol) irked Schenker, and it was perhaps the advertising of Schoenberg's Second String Quartet and <hi rend="italic">Klavierst&#xFC;cke</hi>, Op. 11 in the 1910 catalog that marked the first decisive moment at which Schenker turned against the Director.  Hertzka clearly valued Schenker's work, and was unfailingly courteous in his dealings with him;  nevertheless Schenker showed increasing acrimony toward him throughout the 1910s, alternating with brief reconciliations during which Schenker articulated his vision for UE as the leading music publisher in Europe.  At the same, time, Schenker always insisted on corresponding only with Hertzka rather than with other officials of UE.</p>
        <p>Hertzka's slowness to take up Schenker's planned <ref cRef="kleine_bibliothek"><hi rend="italic">Kleine Bibliothek</hi></ref> (first mooted in 1912) brought the two men to another crisis point in 1914 (diary, OJ 2/9-10, pp. 821-23, December 24, 1914).  When the project eventually came to publication in 1921-24 as <hi rend="italic">Der Tonwille</hi>, Hertzka used A. J. Gutmann as a shield for UE, employing the fictional imprint "Tonwille-Flugbl&#xE4;tterverlag."  Schenker resented this and Hertzka's exerting of editorial control, calling him "wrong, biased, and terroristic" (OC 52/574, February 20, 1923), and accusing him of censorship as well as of administrative incompetence and falsifying accounts.  Schenker resorted to an attorney in Fall 1924 in preparation for legal proceedings against UE, but after a year of recriminations, a settlement was agreed on December 10, 1925 that resulted in <hi rend="italic">Der Tonwille</hi> being continued with Drei Masken Verlag of Munich under the title <hi rend="italic">Das Meisterwerk in der Musik</hi> (1925, 1926, 1930).  After a four-year silence between the two men, correspondence began again in December 1928, and eventually normal civilities were restored;  UE became Schenker's principal publisher again, issuing <hi rend="italic">Der freie Satz</hi> posthumously in 1935.</p>
        <p>Hertzka was Jewish.  Like Schenker, and most Viennese Jews at the time, he sought to assimilate into German culture.  He was, however, a cosmopolitan Jew, nurturing an international network of business and cultural relationships within and beyond Europe, and traveling frequently to forge deals, develop personal contacts, and attend important performances;  Schenker, conversely, was a German nationalist, detested the Romance and Anglo-Saxon nations, and saw commerce and trade as detrimental to the world of the mind and to the arts.  Hertzka was a pacifist and believed in democracy;  Schenker had militaristic tendencies and believed in rule by an enlightened aristocracy.  Hertzka was optimistic about the future of music;  Schenker saw all about him only signs of its downfall.</p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="bold">Correspondence</hi>
        </p>
        <p>Correspondence between Hertzka and Schenker is one of the largest exchanges of letters among Schenker's papers.  It covers 1908 to 1931, and survives as WSLB 1-144 and much of OC 52.</p>
